# Juror Return Roster Fix - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem

When a juror returns to the game (via Jury Return competition or America's Vote), the roster behavior was not properly handling the transition:

1. **Issue 1**: The `__evictAnimated` flag was not cleared, potentially causing stale state
2. **Issue 2**: Documentation claimed returned jurors would restore to original position, but this needed verification
3. **Issue 3**: No explicit test for the juror return scenario

## ✅ Solution

### Code Changes

**File: `js/jury_return.js` (Line 126)**
```javascript
// Before:
if(w){ w.evicted=false; delete w.weekEvicted; }

// After:
if(w){ w.evicted=false; delete w.weekEvicted; delete w.__evictAnimated; }
```

**File: `js/jury_return_vote.js` (Line 201)**
```javascript
// Before:
const p=global.getP?.(winnerId); if(p){ p.evicted=false; delete p.weekEvicted; }

// After:
const p=global.getP?.(winnerId); if(p){ p.evicted=false; delete p.weekEvicted; delete p.__evictAnimated; }
```

### Why This Works

The roster rendering logic in `js/ui.hud-and-router.js` (lines 573-590) filters players into two groups:

1. **Active Players**: `!p.evicted` - maintains original order
2. **Evicted Players**: `p.evicted` - sorted by eviction week

When a juror returns:
- Setting `p.evicted = false` moves them to the active players group
- Deleting `weekEvicted` removes eviction metadata
- **Deleting `__evictAnimated`** ensures clean state for potential future eviction
- The player's `__originalIndex` is preserved, so they appear in their original position

### Visual Behavior

**On Eviction:**
1. Player moved to end of roster
2. SVG brush X appears with animation (once)
3. Avatar grayscaled
4. `__evictAnimated` flag set to prevent re-animation

**On Return:**
1. Player restored to original position among active players
2. No X overlay (because `p.evicted = false`)
3. Avatar full color
4. `return-flash` animation plays (2 cycles, ~3.6s)
5. `__evictAnimated` flag cleared (ready for potential future eviction)

**On Re-render (after return):**
1. No animation retrigger
2. Player remains in active section
3. No eviction styling

## 🧪 Testing

### Test File
Created `test_juror_return_roster.html` with step-by-step verification:

1. Initialize game with 8 players
2. Evict Player 3 → Verify animation plays, moved to end
3. Evict Player 5 → Verify both at end, in order
4. Return Player 3 → **Verify restored to active section, X cleared**
5. Refresh roster → Verify no animation retrigger

### Test Results Expected

✅ Player 3 not marked as evicted after return  
✅ Player 3 `__evictAnimated` flag cleared  
✅ Player 5 still evicted  
✅ Player 3 tile has no `.evicted` class  
✅ Player 5 tile has `.evicted` class  
✅ Player 3 has no X overlay  
✅ Player 5 has X overlay  
✅ Player 3 in active section (early index)  
✅ Player 5 in evicted section (late index)  
✅ No `.animating` class on re-render  

## 📊 Compliance with Problem Statement

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Evicted houseguests moved to end | ✅ Already implemented | Lines 573-590 in renderTopRoster() |
| Evicted in order | ✅ Already implemented | Line 588: Sort by weekEvicted |
| Active houseguests in original order | ✅ Already implemented | Line 579: __originalIndex preserved |
| Animation triggers only once | ✅ Already implemented | Line 625-626: __evictAnimated flag |
| No retrigger on re-renders | ✅ Already implemented | Line 625: Check !p.__evictAnimated |
| Juror return: restore position | ✅ Verified | Line 580-584: !p.evicted → activePlayers |
| Juror return: clear styling | ✅ **Fixed** | Added: delete p.__evictAnimated |
| Juror return: no animation retrigger | ✅ Verified | No X shown when p.evicted=false |
| Mobile auto-scroll | ✅ Already implemented | Lines 708-718 |
| Scroll-snap | ✅ Already implemented | CSS line 1263, 1307 |
| Robust to multiple evictions/returns | ✅ Verified | __originalIndex never deleted |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Flow

```
Eviction Flow:
1. p.evicted = true
2. p.weekEvicted = currentWeek
3. renderTopRoster() → player in evictedPlayers array
4. p.__evictAnimated set to true on first render
5. X overlay added with .animating class
6. Future renders: X static (no .animating)

Return Flow:
1. p.evicted = false
2. delete p.weekEvicted
3. delete p.__evictAnimated  ← NEW FIX
4. renderTopRoster() → player in activePlayers array
5. No X overlay (p.evicted check fails)
6. return-flash animation plays
7. Player in original position (via __originalIndex)
```

### Key Variables

- `p.evicted`: Boolean flag determining active vs evicted status
- `p.weekEvicted`: Week number for sorting evicted players
- `p.__evictAnimated`: Flag to prevent animation retrigger (cleared on return)
- `p.__originalIndex`: Original roster position (preserved forever)
- `game.__returnFlashId`: Temporary ID for return-flash animation

## 🎨 Visual Examples

### Scenario: 8 Players, Evict P3 and P5, Return P3

**After Evictions:**
```
[P1] [P2] [P4] [P6] [P7] [P8] | [P3❌] [P5❌]
     Active (original order)    |  Evicted (by week)
```

**After P3 Returns:**
```
[P1] [P2] [P3✨] [P4] [P6] [P7] [P8] | [P5❌]
     Active (P3 restored)          |  Evicted
```

Legend:
- ❌ = Evicted with X overlay
- ✨ = Return flash animation
- No symbol = Normal active player

## 🔍 Edge Cases Handled

1. **Multiple returns in same game**: Each return clears `__evictAnimated`, allowing proper re-eviction
2. **Return then re-evict**: Animation will play again (correct behavior)
3. **Return during re-render**: No issues, player immediately appears in active section
4. **Return with no active players**: Auto-scroll logic handles gracefully
5. **Return with full roster**: Scroll-snap ensures smooth navigation
