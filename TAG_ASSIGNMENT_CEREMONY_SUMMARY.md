# Tag Assignment and Ceremony Logic Refactor - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses the requirements to refactor tag assignment and ceremony logic to fix bugs and improve UX.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Badge Reset at New Week Start (js/eviction.js)
**Problem:** Badges (HOH, POV, NOM) were not being cleared at the start of a new week after eviction.

**Solution:** Enhanced `proceedNextWeek()` function to:
- Clear all badge-related game state: `g.hohId`, `g.vetoHolder`, `g.nominees`, `g.nomsLocked`
- Reset all player badge flags: `p.hoh`, `p.nominated`, `p.nominationState`
- Call `syncPlayerBadgeStates()` to ensure consistency
- Added console logging for debugging

**Code Location:** Lines 788-815 in `js/eviction.js`

### 2. Enhanced Nomination Ceremony UI (js/nominations.js)
**Problem:** Nomination ceremony did not show suspenseful wildcard reveals before displaying nominees.

**Solution:** Refactored the `finalizeNoms()` ceremony sequence to:
1. HOH addresses the house (as before)
2. **NEW:** Show wildcard slots ('?') for each nominee position sequentially
3. **NEW:** Reveal each nominee with their name sequentially
4. **NEW:** Display "This ceremony is adjourned" message
5. Update nominee tags and advance to next phase

**Code Location:** Lines 187-227 in `js/nominations.js`

**UX Improvements:**
- Creates suspense by showing '?' before reveals
- Sequential reveals maintain engagement
- Clear ceremony conclusion message
- Proper timing between cards (1800ms for wildcards, 2600ms for reveals, 2000ms for adjournment)

### 3. Badge Assignment Timing (Already Correct)
**Verification:** Confirmed that badges are assigned immediately upon wins:
- **HOH Badge:** Assigned in `competitions.js` line 718 immediately after winner is determined
- **POV Badge:** Assigned in `veto.js` line 328 immediately after winner is determined
- **NOM Badges:** Assigned in `nominations.js` lines 124-127 immediately after nominations are locked

No changes were needed for badge assignment timing as the implementation was already correct.

## Testing

### Test File: `test_tag_assignment_ceremony.html`
Created comprehensive test suite covering:

1. **Badge Assignment Tests:**
   - HOH badge assigned immediately after HOH win ✓
   - POV badge assigned immediately after POV win ✓
   - NOM badges assigned immediately after nominations ✓

2. **Badge Reset Tests:**
   - Badges cleared after eviction ✓
   - Badges cleared at start of new week ✓

3. **Ceremony UI Tests:**
   - Nomination ceremony with wildcard reveals ✓
   - Sequential nominee reveals ✓
   - "This ceremony is adjourned" message ✓

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully, demonstrating:
- Immediate badge assignment upon wins
- Proper badge clearing at week transitions
- Enhanced ceremony UI flow with wildcards

## Visual Documentation

### Screenshots
1. **Initial State:** Clean slate with no badges
2. **Badges Assigned:** Shows HOH (Alice), VETO (Bob), and NOM (Charlie, Diana) badges
3. **Ceremony Complete:** Shows ceremony flow with all validation passed

## Code Quality

- **Syntax:** All modified JavaScript files pass Node.js syntax validation
- **Comments:** Added inline comments explaining the fixes
- **Logging:** Added console.info statements for debugging
- **Backward Compatibility:** Changes are additive and don't break existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `js/eviction.js` - Added badge reset logic to `proceedNextWeek()`
2. `js/nominations.js` - Enhanced ceremony sequence with wildcards
3. `test_tag_assignment_ceremony.html` - New comprehensive test file

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts:
- Fixes badge persistence bug between weeks
- Improves UX with suspenseful ceremony reveals
- Provides clear test coverage for tag system

### Risk Assessment:
- Low risk: Changes are surgical and well-tested
- Badge clearing logic is defensive (checks for function existence)
- Ceremony enhancements use existing `showCard` API

## Future Considerations

The implementation is complete and ready for production. No additional work is required, but future enhancements could include:
- Animated wildcard card flips
- Sound effects for reveals
- Customizable ceremony timing via config
