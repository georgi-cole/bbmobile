# Card Refactor Implementation Summary

## Overview
This refactor updates all standard game event pop-up cards to use the `.revealCard.diaryRoomCard` class for consistent mobile-friendly styling with overflow protection. Special announcements and overlays maintain their unique styling.

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Files Modified

#### `js/ui.overlay-and-logs.js`
**Function: `renderCard()`** (Lines 346-368)
- **Before:** All cards used base `.revealCard` class, with `.bigAnnounce` added only for `tone='big'` or `tone='announce'`
- **After:** Standard event cards now use `.revealCard.diaryRoomCard`, while special announcements use `.revealCard.bigAnnounce`

```javascript
// New logic (lines 352-356):
if(tone==='big'||tone==='announce'){
  card.className='revealCard bigAnnounce';
} else {
  card.className='revealCard diaryRoomCard';
}
```

**Function: `buildCardWithAvatars()`** (Lines 187-228)
- Same logic applied for cards with explicit actor/target avatars
- Used for social interactions, nominations with faces, etc.

#### `js/social.js`
**Function: `showNextDecision()`** (Line 373)
- Decision cards in social phase now use both classes
- Changed from: `card.className='revealCard decisionCard';`
- Changed to: `card.className='revealCard diaryRoomCard decisionCard';`

### 2. Test Files Created

#### `test_mobile_card_refactor.html`
- Interactive visual testing interface
- Tests standard event cards: HOH, POV, nominations, evictions, social events
- Tests special announcements: twists, competitions
- Tests overflow behavior with long content
- Mobile viewport testing (375px width)
- Desktop viewport testing (800px width)
- Real-time class verification

#### `test_card_integration.html`
- Integration testing with actual game functions
- Uses real `showCard()` and `showBigCard()` APIs
- Tests all common game scenarios
- Includes automated test runner

## What Gets Updated

### Standard Event Cards (Now use .diaryRoomCard)
These cards now inherit responsive mobile styling:
- âœ… HOH competition winners (`showCard('HOH Winner', ...)`)
- âœ… POV competition winners (`showCard('POV Winner', ...)`)
- âœ… Nomination announcements (`showCard('Nominations', ...)`)
- âœ… Eviction results (`showCard('Eviction Result', ...)`)
- âœ… Social interactions (`showCard('Social Update', ...)`)
- âœ… General game messages (any card with `tone='neutral'`, `'veto'`, `'social'`, etc.)

### Special Overlays (Unchanged - Keep .bigAnnounce)
These cards maintain their unique styling:
- ðŸŽ­ Twist announcements (`showBigCard('TWIST', ...)` uses `tone='big'`)
- ðŸŽ­ Competition alerts (`showBigCard('COMPETITION', ...)` uses `tone='big'`)
- ðŸŽ­ Jury return (`showBigCard('JURY RETURN', ...)`)
- ðŸŽ­ Majority clinched (`showBigCard('Majority Clinched', ...)`)
- ðŸŽ­ Cast intro cards (`.introCard` in `ui.hud-and-router.js` - has its own class)

## CSS Classes

### .revealCard.diaryRoomCard (Standard Events)
```css
/* Desktop (from styles.css lines 1208-1222) */
.revealCard.diaryRoomCard {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(1.3);
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1c2b3e, #0e1a28);
  border: 2px solid rgba(120,180,240,0.5);
  border-radius: 20px;
  padding: 24px 28px;
  max-width: min(480px, 92%);
  max-height: calc(100vh - 100px);
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}

/* Mobile (@media max-width: 640px) */
.revealCard.diaryRoomCard {
  max-width: calc(100vw - 32px);
  padding: 18px 20px 20px;
  max-height: calc(100vh - 100px);
}
```

### .revealCard.bigAnnounce (Special Announcements)
```css
/* Unchanged - maintains dramatic styling */
.revealCard.bigAnnounce {
  max-width: clamp(340px, 64vw, 820px);
  background: linear-gradient(145deg, rgba(26,49,71,.96) 0%, rgba(14,26,41,.92) 100%);
  border: 1px solid var(--accent);
  padding: 30px 36px 34px;
  border-radius: 32px;
  /* Enhanced glow effects */
}
```

## Benefits

### Mobile Responsiveness
- âœ… Cards properly sized for mobile screens (`calc(100vw - 32px)`)
- âœ… Content never cut off - automatic scrolling when needed
- âœ… Proper padding adjustments for touch targets
- âœ… Viewport-aware max-height prevents overflow

### Consistency
- âœ… All standard event cards now share unified styling
- âœ… Predictable behavior across different game phases
- âœ… Same responsive behavior regardless of content length

### User Experience
- âœ… No more content cut-off on small screens
- âœ… Smooth scrolling for long content
- âœ… Clear visual distinction between standard events and special announcements
- âœ… Touch-friendly spacing on mobile

## Backward Compatibility

### What's Preserved
- âœ… All existing card rendering logic unchanged
- âœ… `showCard()` and `showBigCard()` APIs unchanged
- âœ… Special announcement styling preserved
- âœ… Intro card styling preserved
- âœ… All game flows work as before

### What Changed
- âœ… Standard event cards now have an additional CSS class
- âœ… This is purely additive - no classes removed
- âœ… Existing CSS rules still apply via `.revealCard`

## Files Changed

### Modified (3 files)
1. `js/ui.overlay-and-logs.js` - 2 functions updated

2. `test_card_integration.html` - Integration testing with game functions

### Total Changes
- Lines changed: ~10 lines (minimal surgical changes)
- New test code: ~400 lines
- Net benefit: Unified mobile-friendly styling for all standard event cards

## Validation

All changes validated through:
1. âœ… JavaScript syntax check (`node --check`)
2. âœ… Visual testing on multiple card types
3. âœ… Mobile viewport testing
4. âœ… Desktop viewport testing
5. âœ… Class verification (automated)
6. âœ… Overflow behavior testing
7. âœ… Integration with real game functions

## Conclusion

This refactor successfully unifies standard event card styling to use the responsive `.diaryRoomCard` class while preserving special announcement styling. The changes are minimal, surgical, and fully backward compatible. All standard game events now benefit from mobile-friendly responsive design with proper overflow protection.
