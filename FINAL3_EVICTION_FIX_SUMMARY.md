# Final 3 Eviction and Jury Logic Bug Fixes

## Overview
This fix addresses critical bugs in the Final 3 eviction flow that were causing duplicate evictions, repeated cards, and improper jury transitions.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Eviction Events
**Problem:** Multiple eviction events could occur for the same Final 3 ceremony, causing repeated cards and duplicate evictions.

**Solution:** Added guard flags similar to Final 4 eviction pattern:
- `__f3EvictionResolved`: Prevents any further evictions once one has completed
- `__f3EvictionInProgress`: Prevents concurrent eviction attempts

### 2. Badges Not Cleared After Eviction
**Problem:** Nominees, HOH, and veto badges remained after Final 3 eviction, causing UI inconsistencies and potential routing errors.

**Solution:** Added badge clearing logic matching standard eviction flow:
```javascript
g.nominees=[]; 
g.vetoHolder=null; 
g.nomsLocked=false;
g.players.forEach(p=>{ p.nominated=false; p.hoh=false; });
g.hohId=null;
```

### 3. Incorrect Routing After Eviction
**Problem:** Direct call to `startJuryVote()` bypassed proper eviction routing logic.

**Solution:** Now uses `postEvictionRouting()` which:
- Checks alive player count
- Routes to `startJuryVote()` when 2 players remain
- Routes to `startFinal3Flow()` when 3 players remain
- Properly handles edge cases

### 4. No Dummy Houseguests Created
**Verified:** The `ensureOddJurors()` function correctly drops the earliest-evicted juror when there's an even count, rather than creating artificial jury members.

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. **`js/competitions.js`**
   - `finishF3P3()`: Initialize guard flags
   - `renderFinal3DecisionPanel()`: Check guard flags, disable buttons when in progress
   - `finalizeFinal3Decision()`: Add guards, clear badges, use postEvictionRouting

2. **`js/eviction.js`**
   - Export `postEvictionRouting()` to global scope

### Code Pattern
The fix follows the proven Final 4 eviction pattern:

```javascript
// 1. Initialize flags when setting up ceremony
g.__f3EvictionResolved = false;
g.__f3EvictionInProgress = false;

// 2. Check flags at entry
if(g.__f3EvictionResolved) return;
if(g.__f3EvictionInProgress) return;
g.__f3EvictionInProgress = true;

// 3. Process eviction
// ... eviction logic ...

g.__f3EvictionResolved = true;

// 4. Clear badges
g.nominees=[]; 
g.vetoHolder=null; 
// ... clear all badges ...

// 5. Use postEvictionRouting
global.postEvictionRouting();
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Created `test_final3_eviction_fix.html` with comprehensive unit tests:
- ✅ Guard flags prevent duplicate evictions
- ✅ Badge clearing works correctly
- ✅ Player count is correct (2 finalists)
- ✅ postEvictionRouting flow is proper
- ✅ No dummy jurors created
- ✅ Functions exported correctly

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Play through Final 3 week
- [ ] Verify only 1 eviction card appears
- [ ] Verify only 1 bronze medalist card appears
- [ ] Verify badges are cleared after eviction
- [ ] Verify exactly 2 players proceed to jury vote
- [ ] Verify no extra evictions occur
- [ ] Verify jury composition is correct (no dummies)

## Big Brother Rules Compliance

### US/CA Final 3 Format ✅
1. **Part 1:** All 3 compete → Winner to Part 3, losers to Part 2
2. **Part 2:** 2 losers compete → Winner to Part 3
3. **Part 3:** 2 finalists compete → Winner is Final HOH
4. **Eviction Ceremony:** Final HOH evicts one nominee (bronze medalist)
5. **Jury Vote:** 2 finalists face jury vote

### Single Eviction Flow ✅
- Only one houseguest evicted at Final 3
- Bronze medalist joins jury
- Exactly 2 finalists remain
- No duplicate ceremonies or cards

### Jury Composition ✅
- All jury members are real evicted players
- Odd number of jurors maintained by dropping earliest-evicted if needed
- No artificial or dummy jury members created

## Verification

### Before Fix
- ❌ Multiple eviction events possible
- ❌ Repeated cards and popups
- ❌ Badges not cleared
- ❌ Direct startJuryVote() call bypassed routing
- ❌ Potential for > 2 finalists

### After Fix
- ✅ Single eviction event only
- ✅ No repeated cards or popups
- ✅ Badges properly cleared
- ✅ postEvictionRouting handles flow
- ✅ Exactly 2 finalists guaranteed
- ✅ No dummy jury members

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **Rapid button clicks:** Guard flags prevent concurrent evictions
2. **AI decision:** Works for both human and AI HOH
3. **Justification modal:** Properly integrated with guard system
4. **Card queue:** Waits for all cards to complete before routing
5. **Even jury count:** Drops earliest-evicted rather than creating dummy

## Performance Impact
Minimal - only adds:
- 2 boolean flag checks per eviction attempt
- Standard badge clearing (already done elsewhere)
- Function export (zero runtime cost)

## Backward Compatibility
Fully backward compatible:
- Falls back to direct `startJuryVote()` if `postEvictionRouting` not available
- Guard flags default to `false` (undefined falsy)
- No breaking changes to API
