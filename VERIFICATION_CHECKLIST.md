## Feature Implementation Status

### 1. Minigame Randomization Fix ✅

- ✅ Enhanced `pickMinigameType()` with lazy retry via queueMicrotask
- ✅ Stale 'clicker' miniMode purge when switching to random
- ✅ Rotating index through shuffled pool for variety
- ✅ Excludes retired games (typing, reaction, slider, path, simon)

**Verification:**
```javascript
// In browser console after game start:
game.cfg.miniMode = 'random';  // Should see variety
game.cfg.miniMode = 'clicker'; // Should only see clicker
game.cfg.miniMode = 'random';  // Should purge clicker mode and vary again
```

### 2. Veto Competition Suspense Reveal ✅
**File:** js/veto.js
**Changes:**
- ✅ `submitGuarded()` logs only "X completed the Veto competition" (no scores)

- ✅ Announces "Revealing top 3..." card
- ✅ Reveals 3rd place → 2nd place → winner (1.2s delays between each)
- ✅ Winner card includes 🛡️ veto badge emoji
- ✅ `finishVetoComp()` synthesizes missing AI scores before reveal

**Verification:**
```javascript
// During veto competition, check logs:
// Should see: "PlayerName completed the Veto competition."

// After competition ends, watch for reveal sequence with delays
```

### 3. Dialog & Speech Variety ✅

## Testing Recommendations

### Quick Smoke Test
1. Load the game in browser
2. Open browser console - no errors on load
3. Start new game - watch for varied minigames
4. Open Settings → check new toggles exist
5. Play through to veto - watch for reveal sequence
6. Check logs show "completed" not scores during veto
7. Play to finale - watch for Public Favourite (if enabled)

### Full Playthrough Test
1. Enable Public Favourite in settings
2. Play full season to finale
3. Verify all 7 features work as expected:
   - Minigames vary
   - Veto reveals work

### Edge Case Tests
1. Disable Public Favourite → verify it's skipped

3. Set miniMode back to 'random' → verify variety returns
4. Check with missing cheer.mp3 → verify no crash
5. Play with <3 players → verify Public Favourite handles gracefully
