## 🎯 Dynamic EVICTED System

The EVICTED event uses an intelligent penalty system:

### Placement-Based Rules
- **Placements 1-5** (Winner to 5th place): **NO PENALTY**
  - Encourages playing to the end
  - Rewards making it far in the game
  
- **Placements 6+** (Evicted before final 5): **DYNAMIC PENALTY**
  - Week 1-2: -100 XP (harsh early eviction penalty)
  - Week 3-4: -75 XP
  - Week 5-6: -50 XP
  - Week 7+: -25 XP (minimum penalty)

### Examples
```javascript
// First player evicted (week 1, 16th place)
onEvicted('p1', 16, 16) // → -100 XP penalty

// Mid-game eviction (week 5, 8th place)  
onEvicted('p2', 8, 16)  // → -50 XP penalty

// Final 5 eviction (5th place)
onEvicted('p3', 5, 16)  // → No penalty (encouraged to reach final 5)

// Winner (1st place)
// onEvicted not called, gets WON_FINAL instead
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Feature Flag Priority
1. `window.progression.enabled` (runtime override)
2. `localStorage.getItem('progression.enabled')` (user pref)
3. `window.g.cfg.progressionEnabled` (game config)
4. Default: `false` (disabled)

### Event Metadata Structure
```javascript
{
  eventType: 'HOH_WIN',
  seasonId: 1,
  week: 3,
  playerId: 'p1',
  payload: { /* event-specific data */ },
  timestamp: 1234567890
}
```

### XP Computation
- Events stored in IndexedDB (with in-memory fallback)
- Total XP computed from event log (event sourcing)
- XP floored at 0 (cannot go negative)
- Changing rules doesn't affect historical events

## 🚀 Next Steps for Game Engine

### 1. Import Event Hooks
```javascript
// In game engine files
import './js/progression-events.js';
```

### 2. Call Hooks at Game Events

#### HOH Competition
```javascript
function onHOHComplete(results) {
  window.ProgressionEvents.onHOHWin(results.winner, results.participants);
  if (results.second) {
    window.ProgressionEvents.onComp2ndPlace(results.second, 'HOH');
  }
  if (results.third) {
    window.ProgressionEvents.onComp3rdPlace(results.third, 'HOH');
  }
}
```

#### Eviction
```javascript
function onEviction(evictedPlayer, placement) {
  window.ProgressionEvents.onEvicted(
    evictedPlayer.id, 
    placement, 
    game.totalPlayers
  );
  
  // Award survivor
  const survivor = getNomineeWhoStayed();
  if (survivor) {
    window.ProgressionEvents.onSurviveNomination(survivor.id);
  }
}
```

#### Finale
```javascript
function onFinale(results) {
  // Log winner
  window.ProgressionEvents.onFinalWinner(results.winnerId);
  
  // Log each jury vote
  results.juryVotes.forEach(vote => {
    window.ProgressionEvents.onJuryVote(vote.finalistId);
  });
  
  // Check for unanimous win
  if (results.unanimous) {
    window.ProgressionEvents.onWonAllJuryVotes(
      results.winnerId, 
      results.totalVotes
    );
  }
}
```

### 3. Enable Feature Flag
```javascript
// In game settings or config
window.progression = { enabled: true };
// OR
localStorage.setItem('progression.enabled', 'true');
// OR
window.g.cfg.progressionEnabled = true;
```

### 4. Test & Verify
- Events logged to IndexedDB
- XP visible in leaderboard
- Modal shows breakdown
- All calculations correct
