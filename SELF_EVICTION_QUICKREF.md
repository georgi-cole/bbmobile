# Self-Eviction Quick Reference

## How It Works

### For Players
1. **Exit Button** appears in top-right corner during active gameplay (ðŸšª door icon)
2. Click button to trigger self-eviction
3. Confirm action in modal (or cancel to stay)
4. Player is immediately evicted and removed from game

### For Developers

#### Main API
```javascript
// Request human self-eviction (shows confirmation)
await window.selfEviction.requestHuman(playerId);

// Direct self-eviction (no confirmation)
window.selfEviction.handle(playerId, origin);
// origin: 'human', 'ai', 'manual', 'admin'

// Check if AI can self-evict now
window.selfEviction.isAISafeWindow(); // true if safe

// Get player's current role
window.selfEviction.getPlayerRole(playerId);
// returns: { isNominee, isHOH, isPOV, isNone }

// Get current phase context
window.selfEviction.getPhaseContext();
// returns: { phase, aliveCount, isEndgame, beforeVeto, afterVeto, ... }
```

#### Backward Compatibility
```javascript
// Legacy API still works
window.handleSelfEviction(playerId, 'self');
```

## Phase-Specific Behavior

### Nominee Self-Evicts
- **Before veto**: HOH must renominate replacement
- **After veto/during vote**: Votes invalidated, null eviction, week ends

### HOH Self-Evicts
- Week cancelled
- All nominations cleared
- No other eviction occurs

### POV Holder Self-Evicts
- **Before ceremony**: Veto ceremony skipped, proceed to voting
- **After ceremony**: Week continues normally
- **At F4**: Skip directly to F3

### Non-Role Player
- Standard eviction
- Week continues

## Safety Features

### Idempotency
- Can't evict same player twice
- Safe to call multiple times
- Guard flags prevent race conditions

### AI Restrictions
- AI can only self-evict during intermission (between eviction and HOH)
- Attempts in other phases show warning and are blocked

### UX Safety
- Exit button only visible for active human player
- Hidden during lobby and finale
- Confirmation modal prevents accidents
- Clear warning about irreversible action

## Testing

### Run Test Suite
1. Open `test_self_eviction.html` in browser
2. Click "Run All Tests"
3. Verify all 9 tests pass

### Manual Testing
1. Start game with human player
2. Look for ðŸšª button in topbar (appears after lobby)
3. Click to trigger confirmation
4. Confirm to test eviction
5. Verify player evicted and count decreases

## Configuration

### Enable AI Self-Eviction
In Settings â†’ Twists:
- Set "Auto-eviction %" to desired chance (0-2%)
- AI players will randomly self-evict during intermission

### Admin/Debug Access
In Settings â†’ Quick Actions:
- Select player from dropdown
- Click "Self-Evict Selected Player"
- Confirm action

## Troubleshooting

### Exit button not appearing?
- Check if game is in active phase (not lobby/finale)
- Verify human player is not already evicted
- Ensure self-eviction.js is loaded (check console)

### Self-eviction not working?
- Check console for errors
- Verify player ID is valid
- Ensure player is not already evicted
- Check if in safe window for AI

### Tests failing?
- Ensure self-eviction.js loads before test
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Verify mock functions are working

## Edge Cases Handled

âœ… Duplicate eviction attempts blocked  
âœ… Already-evicted players rejected  
âœ… Invalid player IDs handled gracefully  
âœ… Vote invalidation when nominee self-evicts during voting  
âœ… Badge clearing after all eviction types  
âœ… Jury integration for applicable players  
âœ… Final rank assignment based on remaining count  
âœ… F4 â†’ F3 transition when POV holder self-evicts  
âœ… Week cancellation when HOH self-evicts  
âœ… Renomination when nominee self-evicts pre-veto
