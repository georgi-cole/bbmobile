# Final 3 Eviction Fix - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed?
The Final 3 eviction ceremony had several critical bugs causing duplicate evictions, repeated cards, and improper flow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Guard Flags (`js/competitions.js`)
```javascript
// Prevents duplicate evictions
g.__f3EvictionResolved = false;
g.__f3EvictionInProgress = false;
```

### 2. Badge Clearing (`js/competitions.js`)
```javascript
// Clears all badges after eviction
g.nominees=[]; g.vetoHolder=null; g.hohId=null;
players.forEach(p => { p.nominated=false; p.hoh=false; });
```

### 3. Proper Routing (`js/competitions.js`)
```javascript
// Uses postEvictionRouting instead of direct startJuryVote
global.postEvictionRouting();
```

### 4. Export Function (`js/eviction.js`)
```javascript
// Makes postEvictionRouting available globally
global.postEvictionRouting=postEvictionRouting;
```

## Testing
- **Automated**: Run `test_final3_eviction_fix.html` in browser
- **Existing Tests**: `npm run test:all` (all pass ✅)
- **Manual**: Play through Final 3 week to verify single eviction

## Files Changed
- `js/competitions.js` - Core eviction logic (+61 lines)
- `js/eviction.js` - Export routing function (+1 line)
- `test_final3_eviction_fix.html` - Test suite (new, 433 lines)
- `FINAL3_EVICTION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Technical docs (new, 165 lines)
- `FINAL3_EVICTION_FIX_VISUAL.md` - Visual guide (new, 192 lines)

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Guard flags prevent duplicate evictions
- [x] Badges cleared after eviction
- [x] Only 2 finalists remain for jury vote
- [x] No dummy houseguests created
- [x] postEvictionRouting handles proper flow
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Code follows Final 4 eviction pattern
- [x] Comprehensive documentation provided

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. Final HOH selects one nominee to evict
2. Single eviction event occurs (one decision card, one bronze medalist card)
3. All badges cleared (no HOH, no nominees)
4. Exactly 2 players proceed to jury vote
5. No additional evictions possible
6. Proper Big Brother US/CA format maintained

## Key Benefits
- ✅ No duplicate evictions
- ✅ No repeated cards/popups
- ✅ Correct player count (2 finalists)
- ✅ Clean state transitions
- ✅ Proper jury composition
- ✅ Better user experience

## Developer Notes
- Pattern matches Final 4 eviction for consistency
- Guard flags prevent both duplicate and concurrent evictions
- postEvictionRouting provides centralized flow control
- Fallback to direct startJuryVote() for backward compatibility
- All changes are surgical and minimal

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Open game in browser
2. Play through or simulate to Final 3
3. Complete Part 1, 2, and 3 competitions
4. Final HOH evicts one nominee
5. Verify single eviction event
6. Verify exactly 2 finalists remain
7. Complete jury vote to crown winner
