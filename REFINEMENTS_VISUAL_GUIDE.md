The interactive test suite allows you to validate each refinement independently.

## Refinement 1: Modal Timing Fix ‚è±Ô∏è

### What Changed
The jury vote announcement modal now appears **BEFORE** the finalist avatars are rendered, instead of appearing 1-2 seconds after.

### Why It Matters
This creates proper dramatic anticipation. Viewers see the announcement first, then the finalists appear, building excitement for the vote reveal.

### Visual Verification
![Modal Timing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7690386-6e8a-4adc-b0b3-48d321d12ccc)

**Sequence:**
1. ‚öñÔ∏èüëë Modal appears: "Time for the Jury Vote"
2. User dismisses modal
3. Finalist avatars (Alice & Bob) appear
4. Vote reveal begins

### Code Location
- File: `js/jury.js`
- Function: `startFinaleRefactorFlow()`
- Lines: ~1467-1489

## Refinement 2: Remove Duplicate Vote Messages üí¨

### What Changed
Eliminated duplicate vote messages by keeping only the upper vote cards above avatars. Dynamic AI reasons now appear directly in these cards.

### Why It Matters
- Cleaner UI with single vote message
- Less visual clutter during vote reveals
- AI-generated dynamic reasons still displayed
- No loss of personality or variety

### Before
- Two messages per vote:
  - Upper card: "Juror: I vote for Finalist"
  - Bottom overlay: "Juror: [Dynamic reason]"

### After
- Single message per vote:
  - Upper card: "Juror: [Dynamic AI reason]"

### Visual Verification
![Vote Messages](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b0e2326-4656-4c36-a82f-c630bd76a684)

**Examples of AI Dynamic Reasons:**
- "Charlie: Alice played a strong social game and earned my respect"
- "Diana: I vote for Bob because of his strategic gameplay"
- "Eve: Alice made bold moves that deserve to win"
- "Frank: Bob's competition wins were impressive"

### Code Location
- File: `js/jury.js`
- Function: `addFaceoffVoteCard()` - enhanced to accept `dynamicReason` parameter
- Function: `startJuryRevealPhase()` - removed `showJurorPhraseOverlay()` call

## Refinement 3: Winner/Runner-Up Roster Badges üèÜ

### What Changed
Winner and runner-up now remain in the top roster with badge labels (ü•á 1st, ü•à 2nd) replacing their names after winner announcement.

### Why It Matters
- Finalists stay visible in the roster
- Clear visual indication of final placements
- Medals replace names for instant recognition
- Evicted players shown with grayed avatars

### Visual Verification
![Roster Badges](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad33305b-939a-4b52-98e4-ad85a7dc8926)

**Roster Display After Finale:**
- Alice: ü•á (Winner badge)
- Bob: ü•à (Runner-up badge)
- Charlie: Grayed out (evicted)
- Diana: Grayed out (evicted)

### Code Location
- File: `js/ui.hud-and-router.js`
- Function: Top roster rendering logic (lines ~575-582)
- Labels set by: `js/jury.js` - `showPlacementLabels()` function

---

## Refinement 4: Red X Replay Prevention ‚úñÔ∏è

### What Changed
The red X on evicted players now appears once with animation, then stays static. It no longer replays on screen changes or roster updates.

### Why It Matters
- Prevents distracting animation loops
- Performance improvement (no re-rendering)
- Professional appearance
- Smoother user experience

### Before
- X animation replayed every time roster updated
- Multiple X elements could stack
- Flickering effect on screen changes

### After
- X appears once with smooth animation
- Animation completes, X stays static
- Check prevents duplicate X elements
- Remains stable through all updates

### Visual Verification
![Evicted X](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08568275-0723-43e9-9e6c-89874ef595bb)

**Test Interaction:**
1. X appears with fade-in animation
2. Animation completes (0.5s)
3. Click "Simulate Screen Change"
4. ‚úÖ X detected - no replay
5. X remains static and visible

### Code Location
- File: `js/ui.hud-and-router.js`
- Lines: ~552-559
- Check: `if(!wrap.querySelector('.evicted-cross'))`

---

## Refinement 5: Improved X Design üé®

### What Changed
Enhanced the red X appearance for a more natural, less rigid look:
- Subtle rotation (-8deg)
- Reduced font-weight (700 from 900)
- Adjusted opacity (0.92)
- Refined shadow effects

### Why It Matters
- More organic, hand-drawn feel
- Less harsh and aggressive
- Better visual integration
- Professional polish

### Before
- Perfectly straight (0deg rotation)
- Very heavy weight (900)
- Full opacity (1.0)
- Intense, rigid appearance

### After
- Natural tilt (-8deg)
- Softer weight (700)
- Subtle transparency (0.92)
- Organic, balanced look

### CSS Comparison

**Before:**
```css
.evicted-cross{
  transform: translate(-50%,-50%) rotate(0deg);
  font-weight: 900;
  opacity: 1;
  text-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(211,47,47,0.9),
               0 0 40px rgba(211,47,47,0.6);
}
```

**After:**
```css
.evicted-cross{
  transform: translate(-50%,-50%) rotate(-8deg);
  font-weight: 700;
  opacity: 0.92;
  text-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(211,47,47,0.7),
               0 0 24px rgba(211,47,47,0.4),
               2px 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
}
```

### Code Location
- File: `styles.css`
- Lines: ~1033-1053
