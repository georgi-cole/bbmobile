## Technical Implementation

### Module Pattern
All games follow the established module pattern:
```javascript
(function(g){
  'use strict';
  
  function render(container, onComplete){
    // Game logic
    // When complete: onComplete(score);
  }
  
  if(typeof g.MiniGames === 'undefined') g.MiniGames = {};
  g.MiniGames.gameName = { render };
})(window);
```

### Registry Integration
- All 15 games marked as `implemented: true` in registry.js
- All games have `mobileFriendly: true`
- All games have `retired: false`
- Each game has proper type (reaction, memory, puzzle, endurance)
- Each game has proper scoring strategy (time, accuracy, hybrid, endurance)

### Competition Eligibility
All 15 games are automatically eligible for:
- ✅ HOH (Head of Household) competitions
- ✅ POV (Power of Veto) competitions
- ✅ F3 (Final 3) competitions

### Scoring System
- All games output scores in 0-100 range
- Scores are normalized by the existing scoring system
- Higher scores represent better performance
- Consistent scoring logic across all game types
