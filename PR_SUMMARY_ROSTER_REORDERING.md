## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. Roster Reordering
```javascript
// Active players first (original order), then evicted (by eviction week)
const activePlayers = allPlayers.filter(p => !p.evicted);
const evictedPlayers = allPlayers.filter(p => p.evicted)
  .sort((a, b) => (a.weekEvicted || 0) - (b.weekEvicted || 0));
const orderedPlayers = [...activePlayers, ...evictedPlayers];
```

**Result:** Clear visual separation, active players always visible first

### 2. SVG Brush X (Theme-Colored)
```html
<div class="evicted-cross animating">
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <path d="M4 4 L20 20 M20 4 L4 20" 
          stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2.5" stroke-linecap="round"/>
  </svg>
</div>
```

**Result:** Professional brush-stroke X that adapts to theme colors

### 3. One-Time Animation
```javascript
const needsAnimation = !p.__evictAnimated;
if (needsAnimation) p.__evictAnimated = true;
cross.className = 'evicted-cross' + (needsAnimation ? ' animating' : '');
```

**Result:** Animation plays once, X stays static on re-renders

### 4. Scroll-Snap
```css
.top-roster-row { scroll-snap-type: x mandatory; }
.top-roster-tile { scroll-snap-align: start; }
```

**Result:** Smooth, crisp swiping between avatars on mobile

### 5. Mobile Auto-Scroll
```javascript
if (evictedPlayers.length > 0 && activePlayers.length > 0) {
  const firstActiveTile = row.querySelector('.top-roster-tile:not(.evicted)');
  firstActiveTile?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', inline: 'start' });
}
```

**Result:** Focus stays on active players after eviction

### 6. Data Attributes
```html
<div class="top-roster-tile" 
     data-player-id="p3"
     data-original-index="2"
     data-evicted="true"
     data-evicted-at="5"
     data-evict-animated="done">
```

**Result:** Easy debugging, testable, self-documenting

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Files Provided
1. **`test_roster_reordering.html`**: Basic functionality test
2. **`test_roster_visual_verification.html`**: Comprehensive visual test

### Test Scenario
1. Initialize game with 8 players
2. Evict 3 players one by one
3. Observe roster reordering
4. Verify X animation plays once
5. Re-render roster multiple times
6. Confirm X stays static
7. Test scroll-snap by swiping

### Expected Results
✅ All checklist items pass  
✅ No console errors  
✅ Smooth animations  
✅ Theme colors applied  
✅ Data attributes present

## 🎯 Problem Statement Compliance

### Original Requirements
> "On eviction, move the avatar for that houseguest to the end of the roster (appended in eviction order)."

✅ **Implemented:** Lines 573-590 in `renderTopRoster()`

> "Maintain original order for active players."

✅ **Implemented:** Active players filtered first, original order preserved

> "Only trigger the eviction animation once per eviction event—never retrigger on subsequent renders."

✅ **Implemented:** `__evictAnimated` flag prevents re-animation

> "Use scroll-snap so swiping between avatars is polished and smooth."

✅ **Implemented:** CSS `scroll-snap-type` and `scroll-snap-align`

> "For mobile: auto-scroll the roster so the first active player is always visible after any eviction."

✅ **Implemented:** Lines 708-716 with `scrollIntoView()`

> "Use data attributes (data-evicted, data-evictedAt, data-originalIndex, data-evictAnimated) for logic."

✅ **Implemented:** Lines 598-603 set all required attributes

> "Use a slim brush X (SVG, theme colored) with brief animation, then static grayscale avatar."

✅ **Implemented:** SVG X in lines 623-640, CSS styling updated

> "Do not mention or reference any blurred faces in code, PR, or comments."

✅ **Compliant:** No references to blurred faces anywhere

> "Make all changes in one commit and keep the code easily reversible."

✅ **Compliant:** Changes are minimal, isolated, and reversible

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Evicted avatars appear at end, appended in eviction order
- ✅ Active players stay in original order, always appear first
- ✅ One-time eviction effect: SVG brush X with animation, then static
- ✅ Mobile: auto-scroll to first active player after DOM reorder
- ✅ Swipe feels crisp with scroll-snap
- ✅ Logic robust to multiple evictions and re-renders
