# Twist Card Removal - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This PR removes old twist announcement cards (DOUBLE WEEK!, TRIPLE WEEK!, BREAKING TWIST, etc.) and ensures all twist announcements use the new modal system exclusively.

## Changes Made

### 1. js/twists.js
**Removed old cards:**
- ❌ `showCard('DOUBLE WEEK!', ...)` on line 41
- ❌ `showCard('TRIPLE WEEK!', ...)` on line 35  
- ❌ `showBigCard("AMERICA'S VOTE — JUROR RETURN", ...)` on line 76

**Added:**
- ✅ Modal trigger in `startAmericaReturnVote()` for debug "Force Juror's Return"
- ✅ Flag `__jurorReturnModalShown` to prevent duplicate modals

### 2. js/jury_return.js
**Removed old cards:**
- ❌ `showBigCard('BREAKING TWIST', ...)` on line 188
- ❌ `showBigCard('Participants', ...)` on line 189-191
- ❌ `showCard('Competition Begins', ...)` on line 192

### 3. js/jury_return_vote.js
**Removed old cards:**
- ❌ `showBigCard('Stop the presses!', ...)` on line 72-74
- ❌ `showBigCard("America's Vote: Juror Return!", ...)` on line 77-79
- ❌ `showBigCard('How it works', ...)` on line 82-86
- ❌ Flash screen and sound effects (lines 65-69)

### 4. js/ui.week-intro.js
**Enhanced:**
- ✅ Added `__jurorReturnModalShown` flag check to prevent duplicate modals
- ✅ Modal is now shown once and only once per juror return event

## Before and After

### Before (Old Behavior)
**Double/Triple Eviction Week:**
1. Standard card shown: "DOUBLE WEEK!" or "TRIPLE WEEK!"
2. Then inter-week modal shown
3. Then HOH starts

**Juror Return (Competition-based):**
1. Standard card shown: "BREAKING TWIST"
2. Standard card shown: "Participants"
3. Standard card shown: "Competition Begins"
4. Then inter-week modal shown
5. Then modal shown (if conditions met)

**Juror Return (America's Vote):**
1. Flash screen effect
2. Sound effect
3. Standard card shown: "Stop the presses!"
4. Standard card shown: "America's Vote: Juror Return!"
5. Standard card shown: "How it works"
6. Then panel shown with voting

### After (New Behavior)
**Double/Triple Eviction Week:**
1. ✅ Modal shown: "House Shock!" with appropriate emoji and message
2. Then HOH starts

**Juror Return (Competition-based):**
1. ✅ Modal shown: "House Shock! 👁️⚖️🔙 - A jury member re-enters the house!"
2. Then competition panel shown

**Juror Return (America's Vote):**
1. ✅ Modal shown: "House Shock! 👁️⚖️🔙 - A jury member re-enters the house!"
2. Then panel shown with voting

**Debug "Force Juror's Return":**
1. ✅ Modal shown: "House Shock! 👁️⚖️🔙 - A jury member re-enters the house!"
2. Then America's Vote process begins

## Twist Type Coverage

All twist types now use the new modal system:

| Twist Type | Modal Trigger | Old Cards Removed |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Double Eviction | `showTwistAnnouncementIfNeeded` | ✅ "DOUBLE WEEK!" |
| Triple Eviction | `showTwistAnnouncementIfNeeded` | ✅ "TRIPLE WEEK!" |
| Juror Return (Competition) | `showTwistAnnouncementIfNeeded` | ✅ "BREAKING TWIST", "Participants", "Competition Begins" |
| Juror Return (America's Vote) | `startAmericaReturnVote` | ✅ "AMERICA'S VOTE", "Stop the presses!", "How it works" |
| Debug Force Return | `startAmericaReturnVote` | ✅ All cards (uses modal) |

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test file: `test_twist_modal_integration.html`

### Manual Testing
1. **Double Eviction**: Enable double eviction chance in config, play through to trigger
2. **Triple Eviction**: Enable triple eviction chance in config, play through to trigger
3. **Juror Return**: Play until jury house has members and alive players = 4-6
4. **Debug Force Return**: Use debug menu "Force Juror's Return" button

### Expected Results
- ✅ No standard twist cards appear
- ✅ Modal appears before twist begins
- ✅ Modal has correct emoji, title, and message
- ✅ Modal auto-dismisses after 4 seconds or on click
- ✅ No duplicate modals shown
- ✅ Twist proceeds normally after modal

## Screenshots

### Historical Reference (Before Changes)

#### Image 1: Old Double/Triple Week Cards
![Old twist cards showing "DOUBLE WEEK!" and "TRIPLE WEEK!" standard cards](image1)

*Caption: Previous behavior showing standard cards for double and triple eviction announcements. These cards appeared before the inter-week modal and were redundant.*

#### Image 2: Old Juror Return Cards  
![Old juror return cards showing "BREAKING TWIST", "Participants", etc.](image2)

*Caption: Previous behavior showing multiple standard cards for juror return announcement. The sequence included "BREAKING TWIST", participant list, and competition start cards, creating a lengthy and redundant announcement sequence.*

### New Behavior (After Changes)

All twist announcements now use a single, clean modal with:
- Appropriate emoji set (⚠️😱 for double/triple, 👁️⚖️🔙 for juror return)
- Clear, concise message
- Consistent visual style
- Auto-dismiss after 4 seconds
- Click-to-dismiss functionality

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ No standard twist cards are shown; only the new modal appears for twists
- ✅ Juror's return flow always uses the new modal (including debug)
- ✅ Modal visuals and sequence are confirmed for all twist types
- ✅ PR body includes screenshots image1 and image2 as historical reference

## Migration Notes

No migration needed. Changes are backward compatible:
- If `showEventModal` is not available, code gracefully skips modal display
- Game state flags prevent duplicate announcements
- All core game logic remains unchanged

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future PRs:
1. Add twist announcement sounds to modals
2. Add animations to modal entrance
3. Consider customizable modal duration per twist type
4. Add test coverage for modal timing and sequencing
