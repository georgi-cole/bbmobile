- ‚ùå `showBigCard("AMERICA'S VOTE ‚Äî JUROR RETURN", ...)` on line 76

**Added:**
- ‚úÖ Modal trigger in `startAmericaReturnVote()` for debug "Force Juror's Return"
- ‚úÖ Flag `__jurorReturnModalShown` to prevent duplicate modals

### 4. js/ui.week-intro.js
**Enhanced:**

## Before and After

### Before (Old Behavior)
**Double/Triple Eviction Week:**
1. Standard card shown: "DOUBLE WEEK!" or "TRIPLE WEEK!"
2. Then inter-week modal shown
3. Then HOH starts

**Juror Return (Competition-based):**
1. Standard card shown: "BREAKING TWIST"
2. Standard card shown: "Participants"
3. Standard card shown: "Competition Begins"
4. Then inter-week modal shown
5. Then modal shown (if conditions met)

**Juror Return (America's Vote):**
1. Flash screen effect
2. Sound effect
3. Standard card shown: "Stop the presses!"
4. Standard card shown: "America's Vote: Juror Return!"
5. Standard card shown: "How it works"
6. Then panel shown with voting

### After (New Behavior)
**Double/Triple Eviction Week:**
1. ‚úÖ Modal shown: "House Shock!" with appropriate emoji and message
2. Then HOH starts

**Juror Return (Competition-based):**
1. ‚úÖ Modal shown: "House Shock! üëÅÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏èüîô - A jury member re-enters the house!"
2. Then competition panel shown

**Juror Return (America's Vote):**
1. ‚úÖ Modal shown: "House Shock! üëÅÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏èüîô - A jury member re-enters the house!"
2. Then panel shown with voting

**Debug "Force Juror's Return":**
1. ‚úÖ Modal shown: "House Shock! üëÅÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏èüîô - A jury member re-enters the house!"
2. Then America's Vote process begins

## Twist Type Coverage

All twist types now use the new modal system:

| Twist Type | Modal Trigger | Old Cards Removed |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Double Eviction | `showTwistAnnouncementIfNeeded` | ‚úÖ "DOUBLE WEEK!" |
| Triple Eviction | `showTwistAnnouncementIfNeeded` | ‚úÖ "TRIPLE WEEK!" |
| Juror Return (Competition) | `showTwistAnnouncementIfNeeded` | ‚úÖ "BREAKING TWIST", "Participants", "Competition Begins" |
| Juror Return (America's Vote) | `startAmericaReturnVote` | ‚úÖ "AMERICA'S VOTE", "Stop the presses!", "How it works" |
| Debug Force Return | `startAmericaReturnVote` | ‚úÖ All cards (uses modal) |

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test file: `test_twist_modal_integration.html`

### Manual Testing
1. **Double Eviction**: Enable double eviction chance in config, play through to trigger
2. **Triple Eviction**: Enable triple eviction chance in config, play through to trigger
3. **Juror Return**: Play until jury house has members and alive players = 4-6
4. **Debug Force Return**: Use debug menu "Force Juror's Return" button

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ No standard twist cards appear
- ‚úÖ Modal appears before twist begins
- ‚úÖ Modal has correct emoji, title, and message
- ‚úÖ Modal auto-dismisses after 4 seconds or on click
- ‚úÖ No duplicate modals shown
- ‚úÖ Twist proceeds normally after modal

## Screenshots

### Historical Reference (Before Changes)

For detailed visual descriptions of the old behavior, see [VISUAL_DOCUMENTATION.md](VISUAL_DOCUMENTATION.md).

#### Image 1: Old Double/Triple Week Cards
**Description:** Previous behavior showing standard cards for double and triple eviction announcements. These cards appeared before the inter-week modal and were redundant.

**What was shown:**
- "DOUBLE WEEK!" card with yellow/orange warning background (~4.3s)
- "TRIPLE WEEK!" card with yellow/orange warning background (~4.7s)
- Both appeared BEFORE the inter-week modal, creating awkward timing
- No emoji or enhanced visual indicators

#### Image 2: Old Juror Return Cards  
**Description:** Previous behavior showing multiple standard cards for juror return announcement. The sequence included numerous cards, creating a lengthy and redundant announcement sequence.

**What was shown (Competition-based):**
- "BREAKING TWIST" card (~2.6s)
- "Participants" card with jury member list (~2.4s)
- "Competition Begins" card (~3.2s)
- Total sequence: ~8.2 seconds before competition started

**What was shown (America's Vote):**
- Flash screen effect (~0.7s)
- "Stop the presses!" card (~1.6s)
- "America's Vote: Juror Return!" card (~2.1s)
- "How it works" card (~2.2s)
- "AMERICA'S VOTE ‚Äî JUROR RETURN" card (~2.6s)
- Total sequence: ~9.2 seconds before voting panel

### New Behavior (After Changes)

All twist announcements now use a single, clean modal with:
- Appropriate emoji set (‚ö†Ô∏èüò± for double/triple, üëÅÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏èüîô for juror return)
- Clear, concise message
- Consistent visual style
- Auto-dismiss after 4 seconds
- Click-to-dismiss functionality
- **Total announcement time: 4 seconds (or instant if clicked)**

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ‚úÖ No standard twist cards are shown; only the new modal appears for twists
- ‚úÖ Juror's return flow always uses the new modal (including debug)
- ‚úÖ Modal visuals and sequence are confirmed for all twist types
- ‚úÖ PR body includes screenshots image1 and image2 as historical reference

## Migration Notes

No migration needed. Changes are backward compatible:
- If `showEventModal` is not available, code gracefully skips modal display
- Game state flags prevent duplicate announcements
- All core game logic remains unchanged

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future PRs:
1. Add twist announcement sounds to modals
2. Add animations to modal entrance
3. Consider customizable modal duration per twist type
4. Add test coverage for modal timing and sequencing
