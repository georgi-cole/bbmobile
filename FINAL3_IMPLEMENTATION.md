# Final 3 Week Implementation - Big Brother US/CA Rules

## Overview
This implementation adds a fully show-accurate Final 3 week system following Big Brother US/CA rules, featuring a 3-part competition and a live eviction ceremony.

## Key Changes

### 1. Competition Structure (competitions.js)

#### Previous (2-part) Implementation:
- **Part 1**: All 3 compete → Lowest score becomes nominee
- **Part 2**: Other 2 compete → Winner becomes HOH, loser becomes 2nd nominee
- **Decision**: HOH picks who to evict

#### New (3-part) Implementation:
- **Part 1**: All 3 compete → Winner advances directly to Part 3
- **Part 2**: Two losers from Part 1 compete → Winner advances to Part 3  
- **Part 3**: Winners of Parts 1 & 2 compete → Winner becomes Final HOH
- **Decision**: Final HOH holds live eviction ceremony, chooses who to evict

### 2. Code Changes

#### Added Functions:
- `renderF3P3(panel)` - Renders Part 3 competition UI
- `startF3P3()` - Initiates Part 3 competition between finalists
- `finishF3P3()` - Determines Final HOH from Part 3 results

#### Modified Functions:
- `finishF3P1()` - Now advances highest scorer to Part 3 (was: nominated lowest scorer)
- `finishF3P2()` - Now advances winner to Part 3 (was: set HOH and both nominees)
- `renderFinal3DecisionPanel()` - Enhanced with ceremony theme and confirmation dialogs
- `finalizeFinal3Decision()` - More ceremonial messaging for final eviction
- `renderCompPanel()` - Added support for `final3_comp3` phase

### 3. Game Flow

```
3 Houseguests Remaining
    ↓
Final 3 Part 1 (All 3 compete)
    ↓
Winner → Part 3
Losers → Part 2
    ↓
Final 3 Part 2 (2 losers compete)
    ↓
Winner → Part 3
    ↓
Final 3 Part 3 (2 finalists compete)
    ↓
Winner = Final HOH
    ↓
Final 3 Eviction Ceremony (Live, living room style)
    ↓
Final HOH evicts 1 houseguest
    ↓
Evicted → Jury
Final 2 → Jury Vote
```

### 4. Enhanced Features

#### Celebratory Effects:
- 🏆 Emoji icons for competition winners
- Enhanced card messages ("Winner of the Final 3 Competition!")
- Longer display times for dramatic effect (3200-3600ms vs 2800ms)
- Live ceremony theme with 🎬 icon

#### Confirmation System:
- Human players must confirm their eviction choice
- Prevents accidental clicks during critical moment
- Optional justification prompt

#### Better Messaging:
- "Advances directly to Part 3!" for Part 1 winner
- "Winner of the Final 3 Competition!" for Final HOH
- "{HOH name} has chosen to evict {player name} to the Jury"

### 5. Documentation Updates (rules.js)

Updated Section 4b to reflect the 3-part competition:
- Changed header from "Two-Part" to "Three-Part Final Competition"
- Added Part 3 description
- Clarified that Final HOH holds live ceremony in living room
- Explained eviction and Final 2 process

### 6. Testing

Created `test_final3_flow.html` with comprehensive test suite:
- Function existence tests
- Competition phase tests
- Logic flow validation
- Documentation verification

## Technical Details

### Phase Identifiers:
- `final3_comp1` - Part 1 competition
- `final3_comp2` - Part 2 competition  
- `final3_comp3` - Part 3 competition (NEW)
- `final3_decision` - Final eviction ceremony

### Game State Variables:
- `g.__f3p1Winner` - Stores Part 1 winner ID
- `g.__f3p2Winner` - Stores Part 2 winner ID
- `g.__f3_finalists` - Array of Part 3 competitors
- `g.__f3_duo` - Array of Part 2 competitors

### Nominee Assignment:
After Part 3, the two nominees are:
1. The loser of Part 3
2. The houseguest who lost Part 1 (didn't advance to Parts 2 or 3)

## Backwards Compatibility

### Regular HOH/Veto Bypassed:
When 3 houseguests remain, the system:
- ✅ Automatically triggers `startFinal3Flow()`
- ✅ Bypasses regular HOH competition
- ✅ Bypasses nominations and veto ceremony
- ✅ No veto self-saving issues (no veto exists)

### Routing:
In `eviction.js`, `postEvictionRouting()` checks:
```javascript
if(remain.length===3){ 
  setTimeout(()=>global.startFinal3Flow?.(),700); 
  return; 
}
```

This ensures Final 3 flow is triggered automatically.

### Other Game Flows:
- ✅ Final 4 (sole vote by veto holder) - Unchanged
- ✅ Final 2 (jury vote) - Unchanged  
- ✅ Regular weeks (HOH → Noms → Veto → Eviction) - Unchanged
- ✅ Jury integration - Works correctly, evicted F3 joins jury

## Show Accuracy

This implementation matches the Big Brother US/Canada format:
- ✅ 3-part competition structure
- ✅ Part 1 winner advances directly to finale
- ✅ Part 2 losers compete for second finale spot
- ✅ Part 3 determines Final HOH
- ✅ Live eviction ceremony (not diary room)
- ✅ Final HOH has sole power to evict
- ✅ Evicted joins jury for Final 2 vote

## Files Modified

1. **js/competitions.js** - Main Final 3 logic
2. **js/rules.js** - Documentation updates
3. **test_final3_flow.html** - New test file (NEW)

## No Breaking Changes

All existing functionality preserved:
- ✅ Minigame system unchanged
- ✅ Regular week cycles unchanged
- ✅ Final 4 logic unchanged
- ✅ Jury vote system unchanged
- ✅ No new dependencies
- ✅ Syntax validated
- ✅ All existing tests pass

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential additions not in current scope:
- [ ] Justification text input modal for human Final HOH
- [ ] More elaborate ceremony animations/transitions
- [ ] Part-specific minigame types (endurance, physical, mental)
- [ ] Finalist interview cards between parts
- [ ] Jury reaction cards to Final 3 decision

## Summary

The Final 3 week now implements the full show-accurate 3-part competition format with:
- Clear progression through 3 distinct competitions
- Dramatic winner reveals with celebratory effects
- Live eviction ceremony with confirmation
- No interference with regular game mechanics
- Full backwards compatibility
- Comprehensive testing
