# Diary Room Modal Design Improvements

## Problem Statement
The modal window during live eviction looked cut off and unappealing. The design needed:
- Better centering and positioning
- Improved padding and spacing
- Modern border radius and box shadow
- Balanced layout for avatars, arrow, and text
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Modal Container (`js/eviction.js`)
**Changes to card styling:**
- **Background**: Upgraded gradient for better depth
- **Border**: Increased from 2px 40% opacity to 2px 50% opacity
- **Border Radius**: Increased from 16px to 20px for modern rounded appearance
- **Padding**: Increased from 16px to 24px 28px (vertical & horizontal)
- **Box Shadow**: Enhanced with dual-layer shadow for better depth perception
- **Max Width**: Increased from 420px to 480px
- **Centering**: Added `margin: auto` for proper centering

### 2. Improved Title Section
- **Font Size**: Increased from 1.1rem to 1.2rem
- **Margin**: Increased from 12px to 18px bottom spacing
- **Text Shadow**: Added glow effect for better visibility

### 3. Enhanced Avatar Layout
**Avatar Row:**
- **Justification**: Changed from `space-around` to `center` for better alignment
- **Gap**: Increased from 8px to 16px for better breathing room
- **Margin**: Increased from 12px to 18px bottom spacing

**Individual Avatars:**
- **Size**: Increased from 60-80px to 64-88px (clamp values)
- **Box Shadow**: Enhanced with dual-layer shadow including subtle outer glow
- **Border**: Maintained 3px borders with improved shadow effects

### 4. Arrow Improvements
- **Font Size**: Increased from 1.5-2rem to 1.8-2.4rem (clamp values)
- **Text Shadow**: Added glow effect for better contrast

### 5. Message Text Enhancement
- **Font Size**: Increased from 0.85-1rem to 0.9-1.05rem
- **Color**: Changed from #cedbeb to #e8f4ff for better contrast
- **Line Height**: Increased from 1.4 to 1.5 for readability
- **Font Weight**: Added weight: 500 for emphasis

### 6. CSS Support (`styles.css`)

**New `.diaryRoomCard` class:**
```css
.revealCard.diaryRoomCard{
  display:flex; 
  flex-direction:column; 
  align-items:center; 
  justify-content:center;
  backdrop-filter:blur(12px) saturate(1.3); 
  -webkit-backdrop-filter:blur(12px) saturate(1.3);
}
```

**Mobile responsive rules (max-width: 640px):**
```css
.revealCard.diaryRoomCard{
  max-width:calc(100vw - 32px);
  padding:18px 20px 20px;
}
```
