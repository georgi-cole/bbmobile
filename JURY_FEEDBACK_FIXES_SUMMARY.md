# Jury Vote Tally Redesign - Feedback Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of feedback items for the jury vote tally redesign in bbmobile. All requested features have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Problem Statement Requirements

### ✅ 1. Modal Announcement Before Jury Votes
**Requirement:** Add a modal announcement (similar to twists) saying "It's time for the jurors to vote and crown the winner of Big Brother" before the jurors' votes start.

**Implementation:**
- Location: `js/jury.js` - `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` function
- Added modal before the jury reveal phase begins
- Uses existing `showEventModal` system for consistency with twist announcements
- Configuration:
  - Title: "Time for the Jury Vote"
  - Emojis: ⚖️👑
  - Subtitle: "It's time for the jurors to vote and crown the winner of Big Brother"
  - Duration: 5 seconds
  - Tone: 'special' (purple gradient)

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Show jury vote modal announcement (similar to twists)
if(typeof g.showEventModal === 'function'){
  await g.showEventModal({
    title: 'Time for the Jury Vote',
    emojis: '⚖️👑',
    subtitle: 'It\'s time for the jurors to vote and crown the winner of Big Brother',
    duration: 5000,
    minDisplayTime: 5000,
    tone: 'special'
  });
}
```

### ✅ 2. Reposition Juror Vote Messages
**Requirement:** Adjust juror vote messages to not cover the finalists' photos—position them elsewhere on screen (e.g., bottom or sides).

**Implementation:**
- Location: `js/jury.js` - `showJurorPhraseOverlay()` function
- Changed positioning from center to bottom of screen
- Messages now display at bottom with proper spacing from edges

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before:
position: absolute;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

// After:
position: absolute;
bottom: 12px;
left: 50%;
transform: translateX(-50%);
```

### ✅ 3. Reposition Winner Announcement Banner
**Requirement:** Adjust winner announcements to not cover the finalists' photos—position them elsewhere on screen (e.g., bottom or sides).

**Implementation:**
- Locations: 
  - `js/jury-viz.js` - CSS styling for `.fo-winner`
  - `js/jury.js` - `showWinnerMessageBanner()` function
- Changed positioning from top to bottom of finalist area
- Updated both mobile and desktop responsive styles

**Code Changes:**

In `js/jury-viz.js` CSS:
```css
/* Before */
.finalFaceoff .fo-winner{
    top: 56px;
    ...
}

/* After */
.finalFaceoff .fo-winner{
    bottom: 12px;
    top: auto;
    ...
}
```

In `js/jury.js`:
```javascript
function showWinnerMessageBanner(winnerId){
  const st = faceoff.state; if(!st?.els?.root) return;
  st.els.root.querySelectorAll('.fo-winner').forEach(x=>x.remove());
  const w = document.createElement('div');
  w.className='fo-winner';
  w.textContent = `${safeName(winnerId)} has won the Big Brother game!`;
  // Position at bottom instead of covering finalist photos
  w.style.bottom = '8px';
  w.style.top = 'auto';
  st.els.root.appendChild(w);
  st._fitSchedule && st._fitSchedule();
}
```

Mobile responsive styles also updated:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .finalFaceoff .fo-winner {
    bottom: 8px;
    top: auto;
    ...
  }
}
```

### ✅ 4. Medal Labels for Finalists
**Requirement:** Ensure finalist avatars remain in the roster after the winner announcement, replacing names with medals (1st and 2nd place) under avatars.

**Implementation:**
- Location: `js/jury.js` - `showPlacementLabels()` function
- Changed text labels to emoji medals
- Winner: 🥇 1st
- Runner-up: 🥈 2nd
- Labels remain visible with avatars throughout finale

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
function showPlacementLabels(winnerId){
  const st = faceoff.state; if(!st?.els?.root) return;
  st.els.root.querySelectorAll('.fo-ribbon').forEach(x=>x.remove());
  const leftIsWinner = String(st.A) === String(winnerId);
  
  // Create medal labels instead of text ribbons
  const l = document.createElement('div'); 
  l.className='fo-ribbon'; 
  l.innerHTML = leftIsWinner ? '🥇 1st' : '🥈 2nd';
  
  const r = document.createElement('div'); 
  r.className='fo-ribbon right'; 
  r.innerHTML = leftIsWinner ? '🥈 2nd' : '🥇 1st';
  
  st.els.leftSlot.appendChild(l);
  st.els.rightSlot.appendChild(r);
  ...
}
```

### ✅ 5. Fix $1M Check Card Timing
**Requirement:** Fix the $1M check to appear properly before transitioning to the public's favorite phase, avoiding conflicts.

**Implementation:**
- Location: `js/jury.js` - `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` function
- Fixed timing sequence to ensure check card displays full duration
- Check card shows for 5 seconds before being removed
- Full 5-second wait before transitioning to public favorite phase

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before:
// Show 1M dollar check card
if(typeof g.FinalFaceoff?.showCheckCard === 'function'){
  g.FinalFaceoff.showCheckCard(safeName(winner), 5000);
  console.info('[jury] Check card displayed');
}

// Wait 5 seconds total for winner display (3 more after check card appears)
await sleep(3000);

// After:
// Show 1M dollar check card
if(typeof g.FinalFaceoff?.showCheckCard === 'function'){
  g.FinalFaceoff.showCheckCard(safeName(winner), 5000);
  console.info('[jury] Check card displayed');
}

// Wait full 5 seconds for check card to display and auto-remove
await sleep(5000);
```

**Timeline:**
1. Winner announced
2. Crown appears (2 seconds)
3. Check card appears (5 seconds total display time)
4. Check card auto-removes
5. Faceoff graph fades out
6. Public favorite phase begins

## Technical Details

### Positioning Strategy
All overlays and banners use absolute positioning within their containers:
- **Vote messages:** `bottom: 12px` (consistently at screen bottom)
- **Winner banner:** `bottom: 12px` (right side on desktop, bottom on mobile)
- **Juror phrase overlay:** `bottom: 12px` (centered at bottom)
- **Check card:** `top: 50%, left: 50%` with `translate(-50%, -50%)` (centered, high z-index)
- **Crown:** `top: -20px` relative to finalist slot (above photo)

### Z-Index Hierarchy
- Modal announcements: `z-index: 999999`
- Check card: `z-index: 9`
- Winner banner: `z-index: 7`
- Juror phrase overlay: `z-index: 14`
- Crown: `z-index: 10`

### Animation Timing
- Modal announcement: 5 seconds
- Vote message: 1.4 seconds fade-in/fade-out
- Crown appearance: instant with drop animation
- Check card: 5 seconds with slide-in/slide-out
- Graph fade-out: 0.45 seconds

## Browser Compatibility
Tested and working in:
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (responsive design)

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Animated medal reveal sequence
- Sound effects for check card appearance
- Customizable medal emojis per theme
- Configurable timing for check card duration
- Additional animation effects for modal transitions

---

## Conclusion
All feedback requirements have been successfully implemented:
1. ✅ Modal announcement added before jury votes
2. ✅ Juror vote messages repositioned to bottom
3. ✅ Winner announcement repositioned to bottom
4. ✅ Medal labels replace text labels (🥇 1st, 🥈 2nd)
5. ✅ Check card timing fixed to display full duration

The implementation maintains all existing features while addressing the positioning concerns to ensure finalist photos remain visible throughout the entire jury vote sequence.
