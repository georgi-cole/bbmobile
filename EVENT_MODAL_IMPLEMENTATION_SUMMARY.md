# Event Modal System - Implementation Summary

## Objective
Expand and refactor the event modal system for twist announcements and Public Favourite, using a robust global modal approach with sequential display.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Event Modal System (js/ui.event-modal.js)
Created a generalized, reusable modal component with the following features:

#### Features
- **Customizable Content**: Title, emojis/badge, subtitle, tone
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable duration (default 4000ms)
- **Manual Dismiss**: Click/tap to dismiss after minimum display time (default 500ms)
- **Queue System**: Sequential display for multiple modals
- **Five Tone Options**: neutral, warn, danger, ok, special
- **Accessibility**: ESC key support, proper ARIA attributes
- **Callbacks**: Optional callback after dismissal

#### API
```javascript
await window.showEventModal({
  title: string,
  emojis: string,
  subtitle: string,
  badge: string,
  duration: number,
  minDisplayTime: number,
  callback: function,
  tone: string
});
```

### 2. Twist Announcement Integration (js/ui.week-intro.js)
Integrated twist announcements to appear after inter-week modal:

#### Twist Modals
- **Double Eviction**: 
  - Emojis: ⚠️😱
  - Title: "House Shock!"
  - Subtitle: "Double Eviction Week!! Three nominees — two leave."
  - Tone: danger

- **Triple Eviction**: 
  - Emojis: ⚠️💥😱
  - Title: "House Shock!"
  - Subtitle: "Triple Eviction Week!!! Four nominees — three leave."
  - Tone: danger

- **Juror Return**: 
  - Emojis: 👁️⚖️🔙
  - Title: "House Shock!"
  - Subtitle: "A jury member re-enters the house!"
  - Tone: special

#### Integration Flow
1. Inter-week modal shows ("Get Ready for Week X!")
2. User dismisses or auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
3. If twist is active, twist announcement modal shows
4. User dismisses or auto-dismiss after 4 seconds
5. HOH competition begins

#### Implementation
- Added `showTwistAnnouncementIfNeeded()` function
- Checks game state for active twists (doubleEvictionWeek, tripleEvictionWeek, juror return)
- Integrated with existing `startHOH` wrapper
- Exposed globally for use by other modules

### 3. Public Favourite Refactor (js/jury.js)
Replaced announcement card with celebratory event modal:

#### Modal Configuration
- **Emojis**: 🏆⭐🥇
- **Title**: "Fan Favourite!"
- **Subtitle**: "Public vote to determine favourite houseguest!"
- **Tone**: special (purple gradient)
- **Duration**: 4000ms

#### Changes
- Replaced `showCard()` call with `showEventModal()`
- Maintained fallback to card if modal not available
- Kept all voting logic intact
- Only replaced the initial announcement, not the voting display

### 4. Juror Return Support (js/jury_return.js)
Added twist announcement support for juror return flow:

#### Integration
- After week intro modal, checks for twist announcement
- Calls `showTwistAnnouncementIfNeeded()` before proceeding to HOH
- Maintains existing flow and timing

### 5. Testing and Documentation

Comprehensive test page with:
- Twist announcement tests (double, triple, juror return)
- Public Favourite test

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing
✅ All twist modals display correctly with appropriate emojis and text
✅ Public Favourite modal shows celebratory visuals
✅ Modals are dismissible via click/tap or ESC key
✅ Auto-dismiss works correctly after specified duration
✅ Queue system displays modals sequentially without overlap
✅ Game logic proceeds correctly after modal dismissal

### Automated Testing
✅ npm run test:all passes without errors
✅ No lint issues
✅ No minigame validation issues

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ **Twist modals appear after inter-week modal if a twist is active**
- Implemented in ui.week-intro.js
- Checks game state flags (doubleEvictionWeek, tripleEvictionWeek, juror return)
- Displays appropriate modal with correct emojis and text

✅ **Twist modals use appropriate icons and text**
- Double: ⚠️😱 "Double Eviction Week!!"
- Triple: ⚠️💥😱 "Triple Eviction Week!!!"
- Juror Return: 👁️⚖️🔙 "A jury member re-enters the house!"

✅ **Public Favourite modal replaces announcement card**
- Uses 🏆⭐🥇 emojis
- Special tone (purple) for celebratory feel
- Keeps voting logic intact

✅ **Modal is dismissible**
- Click/tap to dismiss after 500ms
- ESC key support
- Auto-dismiss after duration
- Proceeds with game logic after dismissal

✅ **Screenshots included in PR**
- Double Eviction modal
- Triple Eviction modal
- Juror Return modal
- Public Favourite modal
- Modal queue system

✅ **No interference with gameplay**
- Does not block game logic
- Respects existing card queue
- Works with FX toggles
- Maintains callback patterns

## Technical Highlights

### Queue System
- Ensures only one modal visible at a time
- Sequential display for multiple events
- Can be cleared at any time
- Async/await friendly

### Dismissal Protection
- Minimum display time prevents accidental dismissals
- Dismiss hint appears after minimum time
- User feedback for interactive state

### Tone-based Styling
Five color schemes for different event types:
- Neutral (blue) - General information
- Warn (yellow/orange) - Caution
- Danger (red) - Critical events
- OK (green) - Success
- Special (purple) - Celebrations

### Integration Pattern
- Non-invasive integration with existing code
- Graceful fallbacks if modal not available
- Global exposure for use anywhere
- Callback support for flow control

## Performance Notes

- Lightweight implementation (< 10KB)
- No external dependencies
- CSS-based animations
- Automatic DOM cleanup
- Minimal memory footprint

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- CSS backdrop-filter (with graceful degradation)
- Touch and mouse input
- Keyboard navigation

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Custom emoji/icon sets
- Animation variants
- Sound effects integration
- Progress indicators for timed events
- Multi-step modals
- Form input support
- Drag-to-dismiss on mobile

## Conclusion

The event modal system successfully implements all requirements from the problem statement:
1. ✅ Generalized modal utility for custom events
2. ✅ Twist announcement modals with appropriate visuals
3. ✅ Public Favourite celebratory modal
4. ✅ Sequential display with queue system
5. ✅ No interference with game logic
6. ✅ Comprehensive testing and documentation

The implementation is production-ready and can be extended for future event types.
