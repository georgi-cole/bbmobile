# Self-Eviction Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a robust, phase-aware self-eviction system for the Big Brother game with centralized logic, comprehensive error handling, and full UI integration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Centralized Self-Eviction Handler (`js/self-eviction.js`)
- **Phase-aware branching logic** for different player roles:
  - Nominee self-eviction (before/during/after veto)
  - HOH self-eviction (cancels week)
  - POV holder self-eviction (skips veto or continues)
  - Non-role player self-eviction (standard flow)
  - Endgame handling (F4, F3, F2 special logic)

- **Origin detection** for different trigger sources:
  - `human` - User clicking Exit button
  - `ai` - Random AI self-eviction (with safe window validation)
  - `manual` - Admin/settings panel trigger
  - `admin` - Debug/testing trigger

- **Safety features**:
  - Idempotency guards (prevents duplicate processing)
  - Safe window validation for AI (only during intermission)
  - Vote invalidation when nominee self-evicts after voting starts
  - Atomic state updates

### 2. UI Integration

#### Exit Button (Top Bar)
- Added ðŸšª door icon button to topbar
- Styled with `danger` class for visual emphasis
- Visibility logic:
  - Hidden during lobby and finale phases
  - Hidden for evicted players
  - Only shown for active human player during gameplay

#### Confirmation Modal
- Professional confirmation dialog using existing modal system
- Clear warning about irreversible action
- "Stay" (cancel) and "Exit Game" (confirm) buttons
- Prevents accidental self-evictions

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

#### eviction.js
- Updated to delegate self-evictions to centralized handler
- Preserved legacy handler for vote-based evictions
- Maintains backward compatibility

#### twists.js
- AI self-eviction now uses centralized handler
- Shows modal for random AI events (not for manual triggers)
- Respects safe window restrictions

#### ui.config-and-settings.js
- Admin self-eviction panel uses centralized handler
- Maintains existing confirmation flow

#### bootstrap.js
- Wired Exit button click handler
- Added visibility update logic
- Integrated with game state monitoring

### 4. Phase-Aware Logic

#### Nominee Self-Eviction
- **Before veto**: HOH must renominate, else null eviction
- **During veto**: Continue week with adjusted nominations
- **After veto/voting**: Null eviction, votes invalidated, week ends

#### HOH Self-Eviction
- Nominations cleared
- Week cancelled (no other eviction)
- All badges cleared

#### POV Holder Self-Eviction
- **Before ceremony**: Skip veto, show popup, proceed to voting
- **After ceremony**: Continue week normally
- **At F4**: Skip week, proceed directly to F3

#### Non-Role Self-Eviction
- Standard eviction processing
- Update records
- Continue week

### 5. Edge Case Handling

- **F4 â†’ F3 transition**: POV holder self-eviction proceeds to F3
- **Vote invalidation**: All votes cleared if nominee self-evicts during voting
- **Badge clearing**: All role badges cleared after self-eviction
- **Jury integration**: Evicted players added to jury if applicable
- **Final rank assignment**: Proper ranking based on remaining players

### 6. Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_self_eviction.html`) covering:
- âœ… Basic setup and function availability
- âœ… AI safe window detection
- âœ… Player role detection
- âœ… Nominee self-eviction before veto
- âœ… HOH self-eviction
- âœ… POV self-eviction at F4
- âœ… Idempotency (duplicate prevention)
- âœ… AI blocked in unsafe window
- âœ… Vote invalidation

**All 9 tests pass!**

## Key Features

### Idempotency
- Guard flag prevents duplicate processing
- Already-evicted players cannot be evicted again
- Safe for repeated clicks or race conditions

### Atomicity
- All state updates happen together
- No partial state changes
- Rollback on errors

### UX Safety
- Confirmation modal prevents accidents
- Clear warning messages
- Exit button only visible when appropriate

### Game Flow Preservation
- All phase transitions handled correctly
- No broken game states
- Edge cases properly managed

- âœ… Top-bar Exit button present and functional
- âœ… No race conditions or double-processing
- âœ… All in-game outcomes match specification
- âœ… Idempotent and atomic operations
- âœ… Phase-aware branching (nominee, HOH, POV, endgame)
- âœ… AI/manual/human origin detection
- âœ… Safe window validation for AI
- âœ… Confirmation modal with UX safety
- âœ… Vote invalidation when needed

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation meets all requirements, potential future improvements could include:

1. **Analytics tracking** - Track self-eviction frequency and patterns
2. **Cooldown period** - Prevent self-eviction in first X days
3. **Penalty system** - XP or score penalties for self-eviction
4. **Replacement logic** - Auto-replace self-evicted HOH/POV in some modes
5. **Custom messages** - Allow players to leave farewell messages

## Notes

- The implementation preserves backward compatibility with existing code
- All existing game flows continue to work as before
- The centralized handler can be extended for future game modes
- Test suite provides confidence for future modifications
