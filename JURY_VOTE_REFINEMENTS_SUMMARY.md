# Jury Vote Tally Refinements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refinements made to the jury vote tally redesign based on user feedback. All requested improvements have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Refinements Implemented

### âœ… 1. Modal Timing Fix
**Requirement:** Adjust timing so the jury vote announcement modal appears just before the finalist avatars appear on screen (currently appearing 1-2 sec after).

**Implementation:**
- **Location:** `js/jury.js` - `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` function
- **Change:** Moved modal announcement to appear BEFORE `renderFinaleGraph()` is called
- **Effect:** Modal now displays first, then finalists appear after modal dismissal, creating proper anticipation

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Modal appeared after finalists were already visible
renderFinaleGraph(A,B,jurors.length);
// ... phase setup ...
await showEventModal(...);  // Modal here was too late

// AFTER: Modal appears first, then finalists
await showEventModal(...);  // Modal first
renderFinaleGraph(A,B,jurors.length);  // Then finalists appear
```

### âœ… 2. Remove Duplicated Vote Messages
**Requirement:** Remove duplicated vote messages during jury votes, keeping only the upper ones above avatars while retaining AI dynamic logic for uniqueness.

**Implementation:**
- **Locations:** 
  - `js/jury.js` - `addFaceoffVoteCard()` function (enhanced to accept dynamic reason)
  - `js/jury.js` - `startJuryRevealPhase()` function (removed duplicate overlay call)
- **Change:** Removed `showJurorPhraseOverlay()` call (bottom message) and pass dynamic reason to `addFaceoffVoteCard()` instead
- **Effect:** Only one vote message appears above avatars, using the AI-generated dynamic reason

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Enhanced function to accept dynamic reason
function addFaceoffVoteCard(jurorName, finalistName, dynamicReason){
  const text = dynamicReason || `${jurorName}: I vote for ${finalistName} to win the Big Brother game.`;
  // ... display vote card at top
}

// In reveal phase - removed duplicate bottom overlay
// REMOVED: showJurorPhraseOverlay(safeName(jid), dynamicReason, phraseDuration);
addFaceoffVoteCard(safeName(jid), safeName(pick), dynamicReason);  // Single message with AI reason
```

### âœ… 3. Winner/Runner-Up Remain in Top Roster
**Requirement:** Ensure winner and runner-up avatars remain in the top roster after the winner announcement, with badges (1st and 2nd) replacing their names once results are revealed.

**Implementation:**
- **Location:** `js/ui.hud-and-router.js` - Top roster rendering logic
- **Status:** Already working correctly from previous implementation
- **Effect:** Winner displays ðŸ¥‡ badge, runner-up displays ðŸ¥ˆ badge, both remain visible in roster

**Existing Code:**
```javascript
// Label precedence: WINNER > RUNNER-UP > NOM > HOH/POV icons > name
if(isWinner){
  labelText = 'ðŸ¥‡';
  statusClass = 'status-icon-label medal-winner';
  ariaLabel = `${p.name} (Winner)`;
} else if(isRunnerUp){
  labelText = 'ðŸ¥ˆ';
  statusClass = 'status-icon-label medal-runner-up';
  ariaLabel = `${p.name} (Runner-Up)`;
}
```

### âœ… 4. Red X Replay Prevention
**Requirement:** Prevent red X on evictees from replaying effects on screen changes; make the effect play only once at appearance and stay static.

**Implementation:**
- **Location:** `js/ui.hud-and-router.js` - Top roster tile rendering
- **Change:** Added check to prevent duplicate X elements from being added
- **Effect:** X appears once with animation, then stays static even when roster updates

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Evicted overlay with red cross - add only if not already present
if(p.evicted){
  // Check if cross already exists to prevent replay
  if(!wrap.querySelector('.evicted-cross')){
    const cross=document.createElement('div'); 
    cross.className='evicted-cross'; 
    cross.innerHTML='âœ–';
    wrap.appendChild(cross);
  }
}
```

### âœ… 5. Improved X Design
**Requirement:** Improve the X design for a more natural, less rigid look.

**Implementation:**
- **Location:** `styles.css` - `.evicted-cross` styling
- **Changes:**
  - Added subtle rotation (-8deg) for natural appearance
  - Reduced font-weight from 900 to 700 for less harsh look
  - Adjusted opacity to 0.92 for softer visual
  - Refined shadow effects for more organic feel
  - Updated animation to rotate from -25deg to -8deg

**Code Changes:**
```css
.evicted-cross{
  /* ... */
  transform:translate(-50%,-50%) rotate(-8deg);  /* Subtle rotation */
  font-weight:700;  /* Less heavy than before (was 900) */
  opacity:0.92;  /* Slightly transparent for softer look */
  /* Softer shadows */
  text-shadow:0 0 12px rgba(211,47,47,0.7),
              0 0 24px rgba(211,47,47,0.4),
              2px 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
  /* Animation plays only once */
  animation:crossFadeIn 0.5s ease-out;
  animation-fill-mode:forwards;
}

@keyframes crossFadeIn{
  0%{ opacity:0; transform:translate(-50%,-50%) scale(0.6) rotate(-25deg); }
  100%{ opacity:0.92; transform:translate(-50%,-50%) scale(1) rotate(-8deg); }
}
```
