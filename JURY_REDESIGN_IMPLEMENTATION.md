# Jury Vote Tally Redesign - Implementation Complete

## Problem Statement Requirements

✅ **Display two big finalist photos directly on the #tv screen (no full overlay)**
- Implementation: Existing glassmorphism design already ensures photos are visible
- Photos remain unobstructed throughout the sequence

✅ **For each juror vote, show a non-covering message overlay with unique, dynamic reasons**
- Implementation: `generateVoteReason()` function in `js/jury.js`
- Reasons generated based on:
  - Affinity levels between juror and finalist
  - Threat/strategy ratings
  - Game dynamics (underdog, social game, competitions)
- Deduplication via `usedReasons` Set to avoid repetitions
- Logic ensures no fallacies (reasons match ballot logic)

✅ **Increment and highlight the voted photo's digit with smooth animations**
- Implementation: Existing pulse animation in `jury-viz.js`
- Vote counts update in real-time
- Smooth animations already present

✅ **After all votes, display a non-face-covering crown on the winner's photo**
- Implementation: `showCrown()` function in `js/jury-viz.js`
- Crown positioned at `top: -20px` (above photo, not covering face)
- Elegant drop animation with bounce effect
- Golden glow shadow for cinematic effect

✅ **Show a 1M dollars check card with the winner's name next to it**
- Implementation: `showCheckCard()` function in `js/jury-viz.js`
- Check card features:
  - Golden gradient $1,000,000 amount
  - Winner's name prominently displayed
  - "Pay to the order of [Winner]" format
  - "Congratulations on an incredible game!" message
  - Elegant slide-in animation with 3D rotation

✅ **Hold for 5 seconds before triggering the public's favorite modal**
- Implementation: Timing sequence in `startFinaleRefactorFlow()`
  - Crown displays: 2 seconds
  - Check card displays: 5 seconds (3 additional seconds after crown)
  - Total hold: 5 seconds before public favorite
  - Then `runPublicFavouritePostWinner()` is called

✅ **Use modern CSS (Grid/Flexbox, glassmorphism, keyframe animations)**
- Grid/Flexbox: Already used throughout (`.finalFaceoff` uses CSS Grid)
- Glassmorphism: Enhanced with `backdrop-filter` and transparency
- Keyframe animations added:
  - `@keyframes crownDrop` - Crown entrance with bounce
  - `@keyframes checkSlideIn` - Check card entrance with 3D rotation
  - `@keyframes checkSlideOut` - Check card exit
  - Existing `@keyframes foPulse` - Vote highlight

✅ **Modular JS**
- Functions clearly separated:
  - `generateVoteReason()` - Dynamic reason generation
  - `showCrown()` - Crown display
  - `showCheckCard()` - Check card display
- Public API properly exposed via `FinalFaceoff` object

✅ **Ensure responsiveness/accessibility**
- Responsive design: Existing mobile breakpoints preserved
- Accessibility: Text shadows ensure readability over transparent backgrounds
- Alt text maintained for images
- Smooth animations respect user preferences

✅ **Preserve all existing vote logic, fast-forward, and flow integration**
- Vote logic: `ballotPick()` function unchanged
- Fast-forward: `finale.fastForwardActive` preserved
- Flow integration: `startJuryVote()` → `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` intact
- Backward compatibility: All shims preserved (`initFinalJuryGraph`, etc.)

✅ **Create sequential screenshots of the feature in action for review**
- Test page created: `test_jury_redesign.html`
- Screenshots captured:
  1. Initial test page with features list
  2. Voting in progress with crown and check card
  3. Final state with winner display
  4. Crown feature detail view
