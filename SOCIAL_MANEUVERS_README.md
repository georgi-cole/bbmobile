# Social Maneuvers System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The Social Maneuvers system is a new feature-flagged module that enhances the social phase of the Big Brother game with an energy-based action system. Players can perform various social actions that consume energy and affect relationships.

## Module Structure

### Public API (window.SocialManeuvers)
```javascript
{
  // Feature flag
  isEnabled(),
  
  // Energy management
  initSocialEnergy(),
  getEnergy(playerId),
  setEnergy(playerId, amount),
  spendEnergy(playerId, cost),
  restoreEnergy(playerId, amount),
  
  // Actions
  getActionById(actionId),
  getAvailableActions(playerId),
  executeAction(actorId, targetId, actionId),
  
  // Memory
  recordActionInMemory(...),
  getPlayerMemory(actorId, targetId),
  
  // UI
  renderSocialManeuversUI(container, playerId),
  
  // Phase hooks
  onSocialPhaseStart(),
  onSocialPhaseEnd(),
  
  // Constants
  DEFAULT_ENERGY: 3,
  MAX_ENERGY: 5,
  SOCIAL_ACTIONS: [...]
}
```

### Social Actions
| ID | Label | Cost | Category | Description |
|----|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| smalltalk | Small Talk | 1 | friendly | Light conversation to build rapport |
| strategize | Strategize | 2 | strategic | Discuss game plans and alliances |
| confide | Confide | 2 | friendly | Share personal thoughts and build trust |
| interrogate | Interrogate | 2 | aggressive | Press for information about plans |
| compliment | Compliment | 1 | friendly | Give genuine praise |
| confront | Confront | 3 | aggressive | Address conflicts directly |
| mediate | Mediate | 2 | strategic | Help resolve tensions between others |
| observe | Observe | 1 | strategic | Watch and listen quietly |

## Integration Points (Placeholders)

### 1. Social Phase Integration
To integrate with the existing social phase system (js/social.js):
```javascript
// In startSocialIntermission or renderSocialPhase:
if (global.SocialManeuvers?.isEnabled()) {
  global.SocialManeuvers.onSocialPhaseStart();
  
  // Render UI for human player
  const you = global.getP?.(g.humanId);
  if (you && !you.evicted) {
    const container = document.getElementById('social-actions-container');
    global.SocialManeuvers.renderSocialManeuversUI(container, you.id);
  }
}

// At end of social phase:
global.SocialManeuvers?.onSocialPhaseEnd();
```

### 2. Memory System Integration
Current placeholder in `recordActionInMemory()` can be enhanced to integrate with:
- `js/social-narrative.js` for relationship stage tracking
- `getPairMemory()` / `updatePairStage()` functions
- Custom memory structure for long-term action history

### 3. Trait Effects
Placeholder in `applyTraitEffects()` ready for:
- Player personality traits (e.g., charismatic, strategic, hot-headed)
- Action outcome modifiers based on traits
- Energy cost adjustments for certain player types

### 4. Outcome Processing
Current basic implementation in `processActionOutcome()` can be expanded:
- More sophisticated affinity calculations
- Integration with alliance/rivalry systems
- Random event triggers based on actions
- Multi-player interaction effects

## Testing

Run the test page:
```bash
# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Navigate to
http://localhost:8080/test_social_maneuvers.html
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Module loading
- ✅ Feature flag (enabled/disabled states)
- ✅ Energy system (set, spend, restore)
- ✅ Action definitions and filtering
- ✅ UI rendering
- ✅ Action execution
- ✅ Memory recording

All 18 automatic tests pass. Interactive tests available via buttons.

## Enabling the Feature

The feature is **enabled by default**. Players will automatically see the Social Maneuvers UI during social phases.

### To Disable (Optional)
1. Open Settings → Gameplay tab
2. Uncheck "Enable Social Maneuvers system (experimental)"
3. Click "Save & Close"
4. The game will revert to the legacy social phase system

### For Development
```javascript
// Disable the feature
game.cfg.enableSocialManeuvers = false;

// Re-enable the feature
game.cfg.enableSocialManeuvers = true;
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Current) ✅
- [x] Basic energy system
- [x] Action definitions
- [x] Feature flag
- [x] UI skeleton
- [x] Memory placeholders

### Phase 2 (Next Steps)
- [ ] Integrate with social.js renderSocialPhase()
- [ ] Connect to social-narrative.js memory system
- [ ] Add player trait definitions
- [ ] Implement trait-based modifiers
- [ ] Create action outcome variations

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] AI decision-making for NPC actions
- [ ] Multi-turn social strategies
- [ ] Alliance formation via actions
- [ ] Social mini-events triggered by actions
- [ ] Visual feedback and animations

### Phase 4 (Polish)
- [ ] Tutorial/onboarding for new system
- [ ] Achievement tracking for social actions
- [ ] Analytics/stats panel
- [ ] Balance tuning based on gameplay data

## Architecture Notes

### Design Principles
1. **Feature-Flagged**: Enabled by default, users can opt-out via settings
2. **Non-Breaking**: No impact on existing game logic when disabled
3. **Modular**: Self-contained module with clear API
4. **Extensible**: Placeholder hooks for future enhancements
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Memory Management
- Energy state stored in `game.__socialEnergy` Map
- Action history in `game.__socialManeuversMemory` object
- History limited to last 50 actions to prevent bloat
- Week/phase tracking included for temporal analysis

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when feature is disabled
- Validation of player IDs and action IDs
- Energy check before action execution
- Console logging for debugging

## Known Limitations

1. **UI Not Fully Integrated**: Currently renders as standalone component, not yet woven into social phase flow
2. **AI Behavior**: NPCs don't use the system yet (future enhancement)
3. **Visual Feedback**: Basic HTML rendering, no animations or transitions
4. **Balance**: Action costs and effects are initial estimates, need playtesting
5. **Tutorial**: No onboarding/explanation for players new to the system

## Support

For questions or issues:
- Check `test_social_maneuvers.html` for usage examples
- Review code comments in `js/social-maneuvers.js`
- Module logs to console with `[social-maneuvers]` prefix
