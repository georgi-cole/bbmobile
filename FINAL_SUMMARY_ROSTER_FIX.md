# 🎯 Juror Return Roster Fix - Final Summary

## Problem Statement
Fix roster behavior so evicted houseguests are moved to the end of the roster (in eviction order), and active houseguests stay in their original order at the front. Eviction animation (brush X) triggers only once when a houseguest is evicted, and does not retrigger on subsequent re-renders or unrelated updates. **Ensure compatibility with jurors-return twist**: when a juror returns, restore them to their original position, clear the evicted animation and styling, and do not retrigger the animation. On mobile, auto-scroll to the first active player after roster reorder, and enable scroll-snap for smooth swiping between avatars. Robust against multiple evictions, returns, and re-renders.

## ✅ Solution Summary

### What Was Already Working
The existing implementation (from previous PRs) already handled most requirements:
- ✅ Roster reordering (active first, evicted at end in order)
- ✅ One-time animation with `__evictAnimated` flag
- ✅ SVG brush X overlay
- ✅ Mobile auto-scroll
- ✅ Scroll-snap
- ✅ Original position tracking via `__originalIndex`

### What Was Missing (The Bug)
When a juror returned to the game, the code:
- ✅ Set `p.evicted = false` (correct)
- ✅ Deleted `p.weekEvicted` (correct)
- ❌ **Did NOT delete `p.__evictAnimated`** (bug!)

This meant the flag persisted, potentially causing stale state issues.

### The Fix (Minimal & Surgical)
Added `delete p.__evictAnimated;` in 4 locations where players are un-evicted:

1. **js/jury_return.js** (line 126) - Juror Return competition
2. **js/jury_return_vote.js** (line 201) - America's Vote return (v2)
3. **js/twists.js** (line 324) - America's Vote return (v1)
4. **js/bootstrap.js** (line 156) - Game reset

**Total Changes: 4 lines changed across 4 files**

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### How the Roster Works

**Rendering Logic (ui.hud-and-router.js, lines 573-590):**
```javascript
// Split players into two groups
allPlayers.forEach((p, idx) => {
  if(!p.__originalIndex) p.__originalIndex = idx;  // Preserve original position
  if(p.evicted){
    evictedPlayers.push(p);
  } else {
    activePlayers.push(p);  // ← Returned jurors go here!
  }
});

// Sort evicted by week
evictedPlayers.sort((a, b) => (a.weekEvicted || 0) - (b.weekEvicted || 0));

// Combine: active first, evicted last
const orderedPlayers = [...activePlayers, ...evictedPlayers];
```

**Key Insight**: The `p.evicted` flag is the **only** thing determining group membership. When we set `p.evicted = false`, the player automatically goes to the active group!

### Why Original Position is Preserved

The `__originalIndex` is set once and never deleted:
```javascript
if(!p.__originalIndex) p.__originalIndex = idx;  // Only sets if missing
```

Even after eviction and return, this index remains intact, so the player appears in their original position among active players.

### Animation State Management

**On First Eviction:**
```javascript
if(p.evicted){
  const needsAnimation = !p.__evictAnimated;  // true (first time)
  if(needsAnimation) p.__evictAnimated = true;  // Set flag
  cross.className = 'evicted-cross animating';  // Animate
}
```

**On Re-render:**
```javascript
if(p.evicted){
  const needsAnimation = !p.__evictAnimated;  // false (already set)
  cross.className = 'evicted-cross';  // No animation class
}
```

**On Return (with our fix):**
```javascript
p.evicted = false;
delete p.weekEvicted;
delete p.__evictAnimated;  // Clear flag ← THE FIX

// Next render:
if(p.evicted){ /* This block doesn't run! */ }  // No X shown
```

**If Evicted Again:**
```javascript
// Flag was cleared, so animation plays again (correct!)
if(p.evicted){
  const needsAnimation = !p.__evictAnimated;  // true (flag was cleared)
  if(needsAnimation) p.__evictAnimated = true;  // Set flag again
  cross.className = 'evicted-cross animating';  // Animate again
}
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

### Automated Tests
- ✅ `npm run test:jurors` - All pass (12 checks)
- ✅ Eligibility logic verified
- ✅ RNG and thresholds verified

### Manual Test File
Created `test_juror_return_roster.html` with step-by-step verification:

**Test Scenario:**
1. Initialize 8 players
2. Evict Player 3 → X animation plays, moved to end
3. Evict Player 5 → Both at end, in order
4. Return Player 3 → Restored to active, X cleared
5. Refresh → No animation retrigger

**Expected Results (9 tests):**
- ✅ Player 3 not evicted after return
- ✅ Player 3 `__evictAnimated` cleared
- ✅ Player 5 still evicted
- ✅ Player 3 tile no `.evicted` class
- ✅ Player 5 tile has `.evicted` class
- ✅ Player 3 no X overlay
- ✅ Player 5 has X overlay
- ✅ Player 3 in active section
- ✅ Player 5 in evicted section

### Edge Cases Tested
1. ✅ Multiple evictions
2. ✅ Multiple returns in same game
3. ✅ Return then re-evict
4. ✅ Game reset
5. ✅ Re-renders after return
6. ✅ America's Vote returns (2 variants)

        - delete p.weekEvicted
        - delete p.__evictAnimated ← THE FIX

Evict Again: [P1] [P2] [P4] [P6] [P7] [P8] | [P5❌] [P3❌✨]
