# Visual Documentation - Old Twist Card Behavior

## Purpose
This document provides detailed descriptions of the old twist card behavior for historical reference. These correspond to the `image1` and `image2` screenshots mentioned in the PR requirements.

## Image 1: Old Double/Triple Week Cards

### Visual Description
**Context:** Before the changes, when a double or triple eviction week was triggered, players would see standard card announcements.

**What was shown:**

1. **Double Eviction Card:**
   - Card type: Standard warning card (yellow/orange background)
   - Title: "DOUBLE WEEK!"
   - Message lines:
     - "Double Eviction Week is active."
     - "Three nominees ‚Äî two leave."
   - Display duration: ~4.3 seconds
   - Card color: Warning (yellow/orange tone)

2. **Triple Eviction Card:**
   - Card type: Standard warning card (yellow/orange background)
   - Title: "TRIPLE WEEK!"
   - Message lines:
     - "Triple Eviction Week is active."
     - "Four nominees ‚Äî three leave."
   - Display duration: ~4.7 seconds
   - Card color: Warning (yellow/orange tone)

### Issues with Old Approach:
- ‚ùå Redundant with the new modal system
- ‚ùå Less visually striking than modals
- ‚ùå Inconsistent with other twist announcements
- ‚ùå Appeared BEFORE the inter-week modal, creating awkward timing
- ‚ùå No emoji or enhanced visual indicators

### Typical Sequence (Old):
```
1. Week ends (eviction completes)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è "DOUBLE WEEK!" card appears (4.3s)
3. Inter-week processing
4. "Get Ready for Week X" modal appears (5s)
5. HOH competition begins
```
