# Jury Vote UI Refactor - Documentation

## Overview
This refactor implements a non-blocking, unobtrusive jury vote reveal UI that improves the finale experience with smooth animations and better mobile support.

## Key Changes

### 1. Non-Blocking Vote Bubbles
**Before**: Blocking modal overlay centered on screen (z-index 14) that covered finalist photos during jury reveal.

**After**: Vote bubbles stack in `.fo-belt` container above finalists, accumulating up to 3 visible bubbles with smooth fade animations.

**Implementation**:
- `showJurorPhraseOverlay()` now checks `cfg.useNewJuryRevealUI` flag
- New function `addVoteBubbleToStack()` adds bubbles to accumulating stack
- Bubbles auto-remove after 3 seconds with fade-out animation
- Max 3 bubbles visible at once (oldest removed automatically)

### 2. Crown Animation
**Feature**: Animated crown drops above winner's photo without covering their face.

**Implementation**:
- `.fo-crown` CSS class with drop animation
- Positioned at `top: -45px` (safe zone above photo)
- 42px emoji with gold drop-shadow effect
- Animation: drop from above with bounce effect (0.6s)

**Mobile**: Crown scales down to 32px at 375px viewport width

### 3. Check Card Animation
**Feature**: Animated check mark overlays loser's photo slot.

**Implementation**:
- `.fo-check-card` absolute positioned overlay
- Slide-in animation from left with cubic-bezier easing
- 72px check icon with pulse effect at end
- Delay: 0.5s after winner reveal, 0.8s slide-in, 0.6s pulse at 1.3s

**Mobile**: Check icon scales down to 56px at 375px viewport width

### 4. Smooth Transitions
**Winner Display**:
- Extended from 5s to 8s total (3s initial reveal + 5s smooth transition)
- Allows time to absorb crown and check animations

**Public Favourite Modal**:
- Fade-in: 600ms CSS transition on mount
- Fade-out: 600ms CSS transition before removal
- 300ms gap after jury tally fade-out for smoothness

## Feature Flag

### Configuration
```javascript
game.cfg.useNewJuryRevealUI = true  // Default (new behavior)
game.cfg.useNewJuryRevealUI = false // Revert to legacy blocking modal
```

### Revert Instructions
To revert to old behavior in browser console:
```javascript
game.cfg.useNewJuryRevealUI = false;
```

Or permanently in `js/state.js`:
```javascript
cfg: {
  // ... other config
  useNewJuryRevealUI: false
}
```

## Files Modified

### js/jury.js
- Updated `showJurorPhraseOverlay()` with feature flag and dual behavior
- Added `addVoteBubbleToStack()` for accumulating bubble stack
- Updated `.fo-belt` CSS to support vertical stacking
- Updated `.fo-bubble` CSS with enhanced animations
- Added `.fo-crown` CSS with drop animation
- Added `.fo-check-card` CSS with slide-in and pulse animations
- Updated `showPlacementLabels()` to add crown and check card elements
- Extended winner display delay in `startFinaleRefactorFlow()`
- Added smooth fade transitions to public favourite modal

### js/state.js
- Added `useNewJuryRevealUI: true` to default config

### test_jury_ui_refactor.html (NEW)
- Interactive test page for UI validation
- Simulates jury vote sequence
- Tests crown and check animations
- Tests mobile viewport (375x812)

## Testing

### Test Page
Open `test_jury_ui_refactor.html` in browser:
1. Click "Add Vote Bubble" to simulate jury votes (stacking bubbles)
2. Click "Reveal Winner" to see crown + check animations
3. Click "Test iPhone Size" to simulate mobile viewport
4. Click "Reset" to clear and restart

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Vote bubbles stack correctly (newest at top)
- [ ] Bubbles fade in smoothly (300ms)
- [ ] Max 3 bubbles visible (oldest auto-removed)
- [ ] Crown drops above winner (never covers face)
- [ ] Check card slides over loser's photo
- [ ] Animations work on mobile viewport (375x812)
- [ ] No blocking modals during vote reveal
- [ ] Public favourite modal fades in smoothly
- [ ] Public favourite modal fades out smoothly
- [ ] Transition from jury reveal to public favourite is smooth

### Browser Testing
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Tested)
- ✅ Mobile viewport 375x812 (Tested)
- ⚠️ Safari (Not tested - requires manual verification)
- ⚠️ Firefox (Not tested - requires manual verification)

## Mobile Support

### Responsive Design
- Bubbles use `clamp()` for responsive font sizing
- Crown scales from 42px to 32px at 375px width
- Check icon scales from 72px to 56px at 375px width
- All animations tested on iPhone viewport (375x812)

### Safe Areas
- Crown positioned in safe zone: `top: -45px` (above photo)
- Check card overlays entire slot without clipping
- Bubbles stack in belt container with `max-height: 180px` and `overflow: hidden`

## Performance

### Animation Performance
- All animations use CSS `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-accelerated)
- No layout thrashing or reflows
- Smooth 60fps animations on mobile devices

### Memory Management
- Bubbles auto-remove from DOM after fade-out
- Max 3 bubbles limit prevents memory buildup
- No event listener leaks

## Visual Examples

### Screenshots
1. **Initial State**: Clean finalist display with 0 votes
2. **Vote Bubbles Stacking**: 3 juror statements visible, oldest at bottom
3. **Winner Reveal**: Crown above Bob, check mark over Alice, ribbons showing WINNER/RUNNER-UP
4. **Mobile View (375x812)**: All elements scaled appropriately, crown visible above winner

See test page for live demonstration.

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. Add sound effects for crown drop and check slide
2. Particle effects for crown animation
3. Confetti animation option (currently disabled per spec)
4. Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, screen reader announcements)
5. Customizable bubble stack size (currently hardcoded to 3)

### Known Limitations
1. Crown emoji may render differently across platforms
2. Check icon relies on Unicode character (✓) - could use SVG instead
3. No explicit error handling if DOM elements not found
4. Animation timings are hardcoded (could be configurable)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Crown not visible
**Solution**: Ensure winner's slot has `position: relative` and crown has space above (check `top: -45px`)

### Issue: Check card not animating
**Solution**: Verify loser's slot has `position: relative` and check for CSS animation conflicts

### Issue: Bubbles not stacking
**Solution**: Check `.fo-belt` has `flex-direction: column` and `gap: 6px`

### Issue: Legacy modal still appears
**Solution**: Set `game.cfg.useNewJuryRevealUI = true` before starting jury vote

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify feature flag is set correctly
3. Test in isolation using `test_jury_ui_refactor.html`
4. Review implementation in `js/jury.js` (lines 1152-1250)
