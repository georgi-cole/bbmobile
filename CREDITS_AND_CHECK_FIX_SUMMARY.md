# Credits Button and Check Card Integration Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement
Fix the credits button functionality by ensuring js/end-credits.js loads and exports globals correctly in bbmobile. Integrate the $1M check into the jury winner announcement screen, replacing the spinning medal with a golden check display for the winner. Keep the credits separate as a video/modal announcing the jury-voted winner. Clean up jury code by removing unused check and medal overlay functions to simplify the finale flow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added end-credits.js to index.html âœ…
**File:** `index.html`
- Added `<script src="js/end-credits.js"></script>` after `finale.js`
- This ensures the credits module loads and exports its global functions correctly
- Functions exported:
  - `window.startEndCreditsMontageSplit()` - Main credits function with split-screen
  - `window.startEndCreditsSequence()` - Simplified credits start
  - `window.stopEndCreditsSequence()` - Stop credits
  - `window.startEndCreditsSplit()` - Backward compatibility alias

### 2. Removed Unused Medal Overlay Code âœ…
**File:** `js/jury-viz.js`

Removed the following (no longer needed as check card is the primary display):
- `showMedalOverlay()` function (13 lines removed)
- Medal overlay CSS styles (28 lines removed):
  - `.finalFaceoff .fo-medal`
  - `.finalFaceoff .fo-medal .medal-wrap`
  - `.finalFaceoff .fo-medal .medal`
  - `@keyframes spin`
- Removed `showMedalOverlay` from `FinalFaceoff` public API

**File:** `js/jury.js`
- Removed `showMedalOverlayFallback()` function (10 lines removed)

**Total code cleanup:** 51 lines of unused medal overlay code removed

### 3. Check Card Integration (Already Working) âœ…
The $1M check card is already properly integrated:
- **Function:** `showCheckCard(winnerName, durationMs)` in `jury-viz.js`
- **Display:** Golden check with $1,000,000 amount and winner's name
- **Timing:** Shows for 5 seconds after crown (2 seconds)
- **Flow:** Crown â†’ Check Card â†’ Public Favorite â†’ Finale Cinematic â†’ Credits

### 4. Credits Button Functionality âœ…
**File:** `js/finale.js`

Credits button in finale cinematic already implements proper fallback chain:
```javascript
panel.querySelector('#cinCredits').onclick=()=>{
  if(typeof g.playOutroVideo === 'function'){
    g.playOutroVideo(); // Try outro video first
  } else if(typeof g.startEndCreditsSequence === 'function'){
    g.startEndCreditsSequence(); // Fallback to credits
  }
};
```

## Complete Finale Flow

### Winner Announcement Sequence
1. **Jury votes revealed** - Each juror's vote shown with dynamic reasons
2. **Winner determined** - Suspense delay before announcement
3. **Winner display**:
   - Final tally banner shown
   - Winner message banner at bottom
   - Placement labels (ðŸ¥‡ Winner, ðŸ¥ˆ Runner-Up)
4. **Crown overlay** - ðŸ‘‘ appears above winner's photo (2 seconds)
5. **$1M Check Card** - Golden check displays with winner's name (5 seconds)
6. **Public Favorite** - Post-winner voting modal
7. **Finale Cinematic** - Winner overlay with trophy and buttons
8. **Credits** - Triggered by CREDITS button

### Credits Separate from Winner Announcement âœ…
- Credits are NOT shown automatically with winner
- Credits only shown when user clicks CREDITS button in finale cinematic
- This keeps winner announcement clean and focused
- Credits as a separate modal/video experience

node -c js/jury.js         # âœ“ Syntax OK
```

### Minimal Changes
Following the requirement for minimal modifications:
- **Added:** 1 line (script tag in index.html)
- **Removed:** 51 lines (unused medal overlay code)
- **Modified:** 2 lines (public API and spacing)
- **Net change:** -50 lines (code cleanup)

## Summary

All requirements from the problem statement have been met:

âœ… **Fix credits button functionality** - end-credits.js now loads in index.html and exports globals correctly

âœ… **Integrate $1M check** - Check card already integrated in winner announcement screen (Crown â†’ Check flow)

âœ… **Replace spinning medal with golden check** - Medal overlay code removed, check is the primary display

âœ… **Keep credits separate** - Credits only shown via CREDITS button in finale cinematic, not during winner announcement

âœ… **Clean up jury code** - Removed unused showMedalOverlay and showMedalOverlayFallback functions

The finale flow is now clean, modular, and properly integrated with the check card as the primary winner celebration element, while keeping credits as a separate user-initiated experience.
