# Post-PR35 Enhancements & Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses all 7 objectives outlined in the problem statement with minimal, surgical changes to the codebase.

## CONSOLIDATED PR: Public Favourite 4-Candidate Upgrade + Card Flush System

### Summary
This PR supersedes draft PR #49 and absorbs PR #50 work, implementing a comprehensive upgrade to the Public Favourite feature:
- **Expanded from 3 to 4 candidates** with adjusted weighting, layout, and tie handling
- **Global card flush system** with abort-safe simulation using generation tokens
- **Enhanced winner card** showing all 4 ranked final percentages
- **Responsive layout** optimized for 4 slots across all breakpoints
- **Comprehensive logging** and debug helpers for QA

### Key Changes

#### A. Public Favourite 4-Candidate Upgrade (js/jury.js)
- **Candidate Selection**: Now selects 4 distinct players (up from 3)
- **Weight Formula**: Retained `weight = 1 + 0.10 * normalizedSurvival`
- **Dirichlet Distribution**: Updated to 4 dimensions `[1, 1, 1, 1]` for start, weighted alphas for target
- **Simulation**: 10s base duration, same smoothing/interpolation, per-tick swing cap=4 points
- **Tie Handling**: At lock time requires top1 - top2 ≥ 1%. If not, extends in 1s increments up to +5s total (15s max)
  - Forced tiebreak for 4 candidates: picks 2 among tied highest, distributes +1/-1
- **Winner Selection**: Highest final percentage (not random from 3)
- **Minimum Players**: Requires at least 4 players (was 3)

#### B. Card Flush System (js/state.js)
- **Global Generation Token**: `g.__cardGen` tracks current generation
- **Timeout Array**: `g.__cardTimeouts` stores all pending card timeouts
- **safeShowCard Wrapper**: Tags operations with generation token
- **flushAllCards(reason)**: 
  - Increments generation to invalidate pending operations
  - Clears all pending timeouts
  - Removes existing card DOM elements (`.bb-card-host` or `[data-bb-card]`)
  - Logs `[cards] flushed (reason=REASON)`
- **Hook Points**:
  - Finale entry: `flushAllCards('enter-finale')` before jury reveal & PF sequence

#### C. Abort-Safe Public Favourite Simulation (js/jury.js)
- Captures generation token at start: `myGeneration = g.__cardGen`
- Each simulation tick checks token via `shouldAbort()` helper
- Mismatch aborts gracefully with log: `[publicFav] aborted (flush)`
- Prevents winner card display if aborted
- Marked modal host with `data-bb-card="true"` for flush cleanup

#### D. Enhanced Winner Card (js/jury.js + styles.css)
- **Winner Display**: Large avatar (72px), name, final percentage
- **Runners-Up List**: Other 3 candidates with smaller avatars (40px), names, percentages (sorted descending)
- **Accessibility**: 
  - `role="alert"` on card container
  - Descriptive `alt` text on all avatars
  - Focus moved to winner card on display
- **Animation**: Smooth zoom-in effect
- **Duration**: 6s display time with abort check

#### E. Responsive Layout for 4 Slots (styles.css)
- **Desktop (≥900px)**: 4 columns, panel max-width 800px
- **Mid (640-899px)**: 2x2 grid
- **Mobile (<640px)**: 2 columns in 2 rows
- **Very Narrow (<400px)**: 1 column fallback with scroll
- **Panel Centering**: `.pfModalHost` maintains flex centering with vertical scroll on overflow
- **Winner Card**: Responsive sizing on mobile (64px avatar, smaller fonts)

#### F. Comprehensive Logging (js/jury.js)
All logs prefixed with `[publicFav]` for easy filtering:
- `start candidates=[id1,id2,id3,id4]` - Startup with selected IDs
- `updating` - First tick logged once
- `extend(+1000ms diff=<diff>)` - Each extension with current diff
- `tiebreak applied` - Forced tiebreak triggered
- `locked durationMs=<ms>` - Lock time with total duration
- `winner:<id> pct=<pct>` - Winner determined
- `winnerCard shown id=<id> pct=<pct>` - Card displayed
- `aborted (flush)` - Graceful abort
- `skipped (need at least 4 players, have N)` - Insufficient players

Card flush logs prefixed with `[cards]`:
- `flushed (reason=REASON)` - Flush executed

#### G. Debug Helpers (js/jury.js)
- **`window.__pfSimDebug(seasons=200)`**: 
  - Simulates N seasons of weighted selection
  - Returns frequency table showing pick distribution
  - Validates weighting formula correctness
  - Console.table output with player stats
- **`window.forcePFRunOnce()`**: 
  - Resets all guards (`__publicFavDone`, `finale.publicFavDone`)
  - Enables toggle
  - Triggers PF simulation immediately for QA
  - Returns Promise for await

### Files Modified
- **js/state.js**: Added card flush system (safeShowCard, flushAllCards)
- **js/jury.js**: Updated PF to 4 candidates, abort safety, winner card, debug helpers, flush hook
- **styles.css**: Updated layout for 4 slots, added winner card styles

### Migration Notes
This PR consolidates and supersedes:
- **PR #49** (draft): Partial layout changes - now absorbed and completed
- **PR #50**: Flush system proposal - now fully implemented with abort safety

## Final Polish & Critical Bug Fixes (Set 1-5)

### Issue 1: Nomination State Machine
**Files Modified:** `js/state.js`, `js/nominations.js`, `js/veto.js`, `js/ui.hud-and-router.js`, `styles.css`

Implemented nomination state machine to persist NOM labels during veto use:
- **States**: `none`, `nominated`, `pendingSave`, `saved`, `replacement`
- **NOM Label Shows For**: `nominated`, `pendingSave`, `replacement`
- **State Transitions**:
  1. Initial nomination → `nominated` (NOM shows)
  2. Veto intent → `pendingSave` (NOM persists)
  3. Veto applied → saved = `saved` (NOM removed), replacement = `replacement` (NOM shows)
- **Logging**: `[nom] nominated player=X`, `[nom] pendingSave player=X`, `[nom] vetoApplied saved=[X] replacement=[Y]`

### Issue 2: Card Builder with Actor/Target Avatars
**Files Modified:** `js/ui.overlay-and-logs.js`, `styles.css`

Created explicit card builder for action cards with avatars:
- **Function**: `buildCardWithAvatars(options)` - builds cards with actor avatar (left), arrow, target avatars (right)
- **Overflow Badge**: Shows `+N` when targets exceed 2
- **Logging**: `[card] build type=X actor=Y targets=[Z,...]`
- **CSS Added**: `.rc-overflow-badge` styling

### Issue 3: Jury Vote UI Safe Region
**Files Modified:** `js/jury-viz.js`

Fixed jury vote bubbles overlaying finalist avatars:
- **Jury Lane**: Vote cards positioned at `top: -80px` (safe region above finalists)
- **Collision Detection**: Checks overlap with finalist avatars, applies `.offset-up` class if needed
- **Offset Fallback**: Moves bubbles up 20px when overlap detected
- **Logging**: `[jury] bubble juror=X offsetApplied=true/false`

### Issue 4: Final Labels After Winner Declaration
**Files Modified:** `js/jury.js`, `js/state.js`, `js/ui.hud-and-router.js`, `styles.css`

Updated player labels to show WINNER/RUNNER-UP after finale:
- **Final Labels**: `showFinalLabel` property set to `'WINNER'` or `'RUNNER-UP'`
- **State Clearing**: HOH, POV, NOM, nominationState cleared on winner declaration
- **Label Precedence**: WINNER > RUNNER-UP > NOM states > HOH·POV > HOH > POV > name
- **CSS Added**: `.status-winner` and `.status-runner-up` styles
- **Logging**: `[finale] labels winner=X runnerUp=Y`

### Issue 5: Integer Score Formatting & Avatar Preload
**Files Modified:** `js/results-popup.js`

Enhanced results popup with integer scores and robust avatar loading:
- **Helper Function**: `formatCompetitionScoreInt(value)` - returns rounded integer string
- **Dismissal Token**: Guards against late avatar injection after popup dismissed
- **Avatar Preload**: Robust preloading with skeleton fallback
- **Logging**: `[results] avatar player=X loaded` or `fallbackUsed`

### Test Pages Created
- `test_veto_nom_state.html`: Validates nomination state transitions
- `test_action_cards.html`: Tests card builder with avatars
- `test_jury_layout.html`: Highlights jury bubble collision detection
- `test_final_labels.html`: Simulates winner declaration
- `test_results_popup.html`: Tests score formatting and avatar preload

All test pages include:
- Interactive demonstrations
- Automated validation with pass/fail indicators
- Real-time console logging
- Visual feedback

No breaking changes to existing functionality. Feature remains opt-in via `cfg.enablePublicFav` toggle.

## LATEST UPDATE: Clean Finale Flow (Removal of Legacy Overlay)

   ├─ Console: [publicFav] start (pre-jury) OR [publicFav] skipped (toggle false)
   ├─ Intro card: "Before we reveal the jury votes and crown the winner..."
   ├─ 5-candidate voting panel with bars
   ├─ Sequential elimination (lowest → highest percentage)
   ├─ Winner enlargement
   ├─ Announcement: "The Public has chosen X... Now let's see who is the Jury's favorite..."
   └─ Console: [publicFav] done

3. Jury Reveal Phase
   ├─ Console: [juryReveal] start
   ├─ Each juror's vote revealed sequentially
   ├─ Live tally updates
   ├─ Winner announced
   └─ Console: [juryReveal] winner=X votes=A-B

4. Winner Display
   ├─ Final tally banner
   ├─ Placement labels
   ├─ Winner message banner
   └─ Victory music (5000ms)

5. Medal Animation
   ├─ Tries medal animation functions
   └─ Fallback to overlay (8000ms)

6. Outro Video (NEW: replaces legacy overlay)
   ├─ Console: [jury] finale complete, triggering outro video
   ├─ playOutroVideo() called
   └─ Fallback to credits sequence if outro unavailable

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Minigame Randomization:**
   - Start new season, trigger multiple HOH/Veto competitions
   - Verify variety of minigames (not just clicker/quickTap)
   - Change miniMode in settings from 'random' to 'clicker' and back
   - Verify stale mode is cleared

2. **Veto Reveal:**
   - Trigger veto competition
   - Check logs show "X completed" not scores
   - Watch for 3-card reveal sequence with delays
   - Verify winner gets 🛡️ badge

3. **Dialog Variety:**
   - Play through multiple nominations/evictions
   - Verify speech variations (should see different phrases)
   - Check console for no errors

4. **Rules Modal:**
   - Open Rules from settings/button
   - Scroll to section 4b
   - Verify Final Week content is present

5. **Public's Favourite:**

   - Complete a full season to finale
   - When enabled: verify audience segment → vote panel animation → reveals
   - When disabled: verify feature is completely skipped
   - Check percentages sum to 100

6. **Audio:**
   - Verify cheer.mp3 plays at Fan Favourite reveal (if file present)

## Integration Fix: Public Favourite Invocation + Confetti Reliability

### Changes Made (Post-PR35 Integration)
**Files modified:** js/ui.config-and-settings.js, js/finale.js, js/jury.js

#### js/ui.config-and-settings.js
- **Added `UI.spawnConfetti()` function** (70 lines):
  - Creates visual confetti celebration effect on canvas
  - Parameters: `durationMs` (default 3000), `particleCount` (default 120, max 300)
  - Respects FX settings: skips if both `fxAnim` and `fxCards` are explicitly false
  - Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
  - Random colors, sizes, velocities, and rotation for each particle
  - Gracefully handles missing canvas element or context
  - Try/catch wrapper prevents crashes

#### js/finale.js
- **Enhanced `showPublicFavourite()` with explicit console markers**:
  - `[publicFav] start` - when feature begins execution
  - `[publicFav] done` - on successful completion
  - `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)` - when disabled in settings
  - `[publicFav] skipped (already completed)` - when guard prevents re-run
  - `[publicFav] error: <message>` - on caught exceptions
  - Hard timeout warning: `[publicFav] timed out after 10s`
- **No changes to invocation flow**: `showFinaleCinematic()` already calls `showPublicFavourite()` after 1.5s delay
- **Debug hook**: `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` already exists for QA testing

#### js/jury.js
- **Added winner confetti spawn** after `showWinnerMessageBanner()`:
  - Spawns 180 particles for 5000ms duration
  - Respects FX flags (skips only if both `fxAnim` and `fxCards` are false)
  - Try/catch wrapper with console warning on error
  - Positioned before victory music starts
  - Independent of Public Favourite confetti (winner confetti always fires if enabled)

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ **Toggle Persistence**: Settings modal loads/saves `enablePublicFav` via localStorage  
✅ **Toggle Default**: Set to `false` by default as specified  
✅ **Toggle OFF Behavior**: `showPublicFavourite()` logs `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)` and returns immediately  
✅ **Toggle ON Behavior**: Executes full sequence with `[publicFav] start` and `[publicFav] done` markers  
✅ **Single Execution**: `g.__publicFavouriteCompleted` guard prevents duplicate runs  
✅ **Winner Confetti**: Spawns after winner announcement, before medal/cinematic  
✅ **FX Respect**: Both confetti calls check FX flags before spawning  
✅ **Hard Timeout**: 10s timeout ensures credits progression even on errors  
✅ **No Blocking**: All async operations properly wrapped with try/catch  
✅ **Debug Hook**: `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` available for testing  
✅ **Console Markers**: All required log statements present  

### Integration Flow

**Winner Announcement → Confetti → Public Favourite (if enabled) → Credits**

```
1. Jury votes tallied
2. showPlacementLabels(winner)
3. showWinnerMessageBanner(winner)
4. ⭐ UI.spawnConfetti(5000, 180)  ← NEW
5. Victory music starts
6. Sleep 5000ms
7. Stop music
8. Medal animation (8000ms) OR
9.   → showFinaleCinematic(winner)
10.      → (1500ms delay)
11.      → showPublicFavourite(winner) if enabled  ← Already existed
12.           → Audience segment card
13.           → Voting panel with bars
14.           → Sequential reveals (3rd, 2nd, Fan Favourite)
15.           → Cheer SFX
16.           → Congratulations card
17. Credits sequence
```

### Testing Steps

1. **Confetti Verification**:
   - Play through to finale
   - Verify confetti appears after winner banner
   - Check console for no errors
   - Test with `fxAnim: false` and `fxCards: false` to verify skip

2. **Public Favourite Toggle OFF**:
   - Settings → Gameplay → Uncheck "Public's Favourite Player"
   - Play to finale
   - Console should show `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)`
   - Confetti should still appear for winner
   - No Public Favourite panel should display

3. **Public Favourite Toggle ON**:
   - Settings → Gameplay → Check "Public's Favourite Player"
   - Play to finale
   - Console should show `[publicFav] start` and `[publicFav] done`
   - Winner confetti spawns first
   - Public Favourite panel appears ~1.5s after winner cinematic
   - Vote bars animate
   - Percentages sum to 100%
   - Sequential reveals work
   - Credits follow after completion

4. **Debug Hook**:
   - After finale, open console
   - Run `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()`
   - Should re-trigger Public Favourite segment
   - Check all markers appear in console

5. **Persistence**:
   - Toggle "Public's Favourite Player" ON
   - Save settings
   - Reload page
   - Open settings - checkbox should still be checked

### Known Behavior

- **No confetti during Public Favourite panel**: Confetti is intentionally only for main winner
- **1.5s delay**: Public Favourite starts 1.5s after winner cinematic appears
- **10s hard timeout**: Ensures credits always progress even if errors occur
- **Guard flag**: `g.__publicFavouriteCompleted` prevents duplicate runs per season

## Finale Refactor: Two-Phase Jury + Public Favourite Intermission (No Confetti)

### Summary
Complete refactor of finale flow implementing a two-phase jury vote system with anonymous casting followed by public favourite elimination segment and final reveal. All confetti has been removed globally per spec.

### Key Changes

**Phase 1: Anonymous Jury Casting**
- Jurors cast votes blind (no finalist names shown during casting)
- Votes stored in `game.finale.juryVotesRaw[]`
- Only juror banter shown (from existing templates)
- Console logging: `[juryCast] start`, `[juryCast] vote juror=X stored`, `[juryCast] complete`

**Phase 2: Public Favourite Intermission**
- Runs automatically if >=3 eligible candidates (evicted players)
- Max 5 candidates randomly selected
- Vote percentages normalized to 100%
- Elimination every 3 seconds (lowest percentage eliminated)
- Bar update frequency: ~170ms (via CSS transition)
- Ties resolved randomly
- Console logging: `[publicFav] start N=X`, `[publicFav] eliminate player=X remaining=Y`, `[publicFav] final winner=X pct=XX%`
- Skips if <3 candidates: `[publicFav] skipped reason=insufficient_candidates`

**Phase 3: Jury Reveal**
- Shows each juror's vote with locked-in phrase (JURY_LOCKED_LINES)
- Updates tally and scoreboard live
- Declares winner after all votes (or majority reached)
- Sets `player.winner = true`
- Shows winner card - NO CONFETTI
- Console logging: `[juryReveal] start`, `[juryReveal] show juror=X vote=Y`, `[juryReveal] winner=X votes=A-B`

**Confetti Removal**
- `UI.spawnConfetti()` converted to no-op
- Removed all calls in: js/jury.js, js/jury_return_vote.js, js/jury_return.js, js/twists.js
- No confetti spawns anywhere in the application

**State Additions**
- `game.finale.juryVotesRaw` - Array of {jurorId, pick} objects
- `game.finale.castingDone` - Boolean flag for phase 1 completion
- `game.finale.publicFavDone` - Boolean flag for phase 2 completion  
- `game.finale.revealStarted` - Boolean flag for phase 3 start

**CSS Additions (styles.css)**
- `.pfv-container` - Flexbox container for candidate tiles
- `.pfv-item` - Individual candidate tile (120px width)
- `.pfv-barOuter` - Progress bar container (10px height)
- `.pfv-barFill` - Animated fill (linear-gradient, 180ms transition)
- `.pfv-elim` - Eliminated candidate style (opacity 0, scale 0.85)
- `.pfv-winner` - Winner highlight (outline, box-shadow)
- Reduced motion support via media query

**Helper Functions**
- `ensureFinaleState()` - Initialize game.finale if not present
- `startJuryCastingPhase(jurors, A, B)` - Phase 1 implementation
- `castSingleJurorVote(jurorId)` - (implicit in casting phase)
- `runPublicFavouriteSegment()` - Phase 2 implementation
- `startJuryRevealPhase(jurors, A, B)` - Phase 3 implementation
- `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` - Main orchestrator
- `getLockedJuryPhrase()` - Returns random locked phrase

**Phrase Pools**
- JURY_LOCKED_LINES (6 phrases for reveal phase)

**Safety & Edge Cases**
- <3 candidates: skip public favourite
- Tie eliminations: resolved randomly among lowest
- Hard safety timeout: none needed (sequential execution)
- Guard functions: castingDone, publicFavDone, revealStarted flags

**Accessibility**
- Live region with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Progress bars with `aria-valuemin/max/now`
- Dialog with `role="dialog"` and `aria-label`
- Screen reader class `.sr-only`

## Enhanced Public's Favourite Player Feature (5 Candidates, Pre-Jury Flow)

### Summary
The Public's Favourite Player feature has been enhanced with new timing, expanded candidates (up to 5), elimination animation with winner enlargement, and updated copy to match show style. The feature runs BEFORE jury votes are revealed, creating a natural transition from jury casting to the winner announcement.

### Key Enhancements

**Timing & Flow Integration**
- Runs BEFORE jury reveal phase (between Phase 1 jury casting and Phase 3 vote reveal)
- New integration helper: `g.maybeRunPublicFavouriteBeforeJury()` for explicit invocation
- Toggle-aware: respects `cfg.enablePublicFav` setting (default OFF)
- Single-run guard: `game.finale.publicFavDone` prevents duplicate runs
- Console markers: `[publicFav] start (pre-jury)`, `[publicFav] done`, `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false/already completed)`

**Candidate Selection (Updated)**
- Selects up to 5 distinct houseguests from FULL season cast (evicted + remaining)
- No exclusions - includes finalists since winner not known yet at this stage
- Random shuffle before slicing to ensure variety
- Minimum requirement: 2 players (reduced from 3)
- Previous implementation limited to evicted players only - now uses entire cast

**Intro Card Text (Updated)**
- Title: "Audience Spotlight"
- Line: "Before we reveal the jury votes and crown the winner. Let's see who you voted as your favourite!"
- Duration: 3000ms
- Previous: "Public's Favourite" / "Who will the audience crown?"

**Voting Animation Panel (Enhanced)**
- Grid class: `.pfGrid5` with up to 5 `.pfCell` tiles (previous: 3 tiles in `.pfv-container`)
- Panel width increased to 700px to accommodate 5 candidates
- Each cell: avatar (with descriptive alt text), name, `.pfBarOuter` background, `.pfBarFill` animated fill, percentage label
- Bars animate from 0% to final normalized percentages
- Animation duration: 5 seconds (reduced to 2s if `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`)
- Percentages normalized to total exactly 100% (integer rounding with fix-up pass)

**Elimination Sequence (New)**
- After bar animation completes, candidates sorted ascending by percentage
- Sequential elimination of all but winner with 800ms stagger between each
- Each elimination: `.pfElim` class applied (opacity 0, scale 0.85, fade out)
- Live region announces: "Name eliminated with X%. Y remaining."
- Previous implementation had no elimination animation - just revealed results

**Winner Enlargement (New)**
- After all eliminations complete, eliminated tiles hidden (`display: none`)
- Winner tile enlarged with `.pfWinnerBig` class (scale 1.5, highlight outline 3px, box-shadow glow)
- Winner occupies most of panel width for visual emphasis
- Scale reduced to 1.2 for users with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- 1.2s delay for enlargement animation to complete before announcement

**Winner Announcement Card (Updated)**
- Title: "Fan Favourite"
- Line 1: "The Public has chosen [Name] for their Favourite player!"
- Line 2: "Now let's see who is the Jury's favorite houseguest!"
- Duration: 4000ms
- Immediately proceeds to jury reveal flow after card dismisses
- Previous: "Public's Favourite! 🌟" / "Name — X%" with no jury transition

**Accessibility (Enhanced)**
- Panel has `role="dialog"` and `aria-label="Public's Favourite Player voting"`
- Live region `#publicFavLive` with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Each progress bar has `aria-label`, `aria-valuemin="0"`, `aria-valuemax="100"`, `aria-valuenow` (updated live)
- Avatar images include descriptive alt text: "Name avatar"
- Contrast-compliant background colors (#1b2c3b)

**CSS Classes (New)**
- `.pfGrid5` - Grid container for up to 5 candidates
- `.pfCell` - Individual candidate tile (replaces `.pfv-item`)
- `.pfBarOuter` - Bar background container (replaces `.pfv-barOuter`)
- `.pfBarFill` - Animated fill bar (replaces `.pfv-barFill`)
- `.pfElim` - Elimination state (opacity 0, scale 0.85)
- `.pfWinnerBig` - Enlarged winner state (scale 1.5, outline 3px solid #6fd7ff, box-shadow glow)
- Legacy classes (`.pfv-*`) retained for backward compatibility
- Reduced motion media query: disables transitions, reduces winner scale to 1.2

**Defensive Measures**
- Skip if toggle disabled: logs `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)`
- Skip if already run: logs `[publicFav] skipped (already completed)`
- Skip if fewer than 2 players: logs `[publicFav] skipped (insufficient players N=X)`
- Try/catch wrapper around entire segment for error safety
- No confetti triggered during this segment (preserves existing winner confetti only)
- Error logging with `[publicFav] error` marker

**Integration Points**
- Old `finale.js` implementation marked as deprecated with warning log
- Debug helper `g.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` updated to prefer new pre-jury flow
- Integration helper `g.maybeRunPublicFavouriteBeforeJury()` exported for external use
- Automatically invoked in `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` between Phase 1 and Phase 3

**Settings Toggle**
- `cfg.enablePublicFav` - defaults to `false` (OFF)
- Located in Settings → Gameplay pane
- Label: "Public's Favourite Player at finale"

**Testing with Debug Helper**
```javascript
// In console after game starts:
game.cfg.enablePublicFav = true;  // Enable feature
game.__debugRunPublicFavOnce();   // Run segment manually

// Reset for re-run:
game.finale.publicFavDone = false;
game.__publicFavouriteCompleted = false;
game.__debugRunPublicFavOnce();
```

## Integration Fix (Public Favourite + Confetti) - PR #39 [DEPRECATED]

### Summary
This section is deprecated. The finale flow has been completely refactored to remove all confetti and implement the new two-phase jury system.

### Changes Made

#### js/end-credits.js
- **Added integration wrapper** (IIFE at end of file):
  - Wraps `window.startEndCreditsSequence` to inject Public Favourite segment before credits
  - Checks `game.cfg.enablePublicFav` flag
  - Finds winner by `p.winner === true`
  - Calls `window.showPublicFavourite(winnerId)` with await
  - Logs `[publicFav] start`, `[publicFav] done`, or `[publicFav] skipped`
  - Try/catch wrapper prevents blocking credits on error
  - `window.__publicFavHooked` flag prevents double wrapping
  - Preserves original function signature and context

#### js/finale.js
- **Removed Public Favourite invocation from `showFinaleCinematic()`**:
  - Public Favourite now runs via credits wrapper (proper sequencing)
  - Added comment explaining the change
- **Enhanced `__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` helper**:
  - Added global `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce` fallback
  - Enables `cfg.enablePublicFav` temporarily
  - Resets `__publicFavouriteCompleted` guard to allow re-run
  - Persists config to localStorage
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Can be called manually from console after finale

#### js/jury.js
- **Enhanced winner confetti spawn**:
  - Changed from `spawnConfetti` to support both `spawnConfetti` and `spawnConfettiOnce`
  - Increased duration to 6000ms and particles to 260 (was 5000ms/180)
  - Added console.info('[finale] winner confetti spawn') log
  - Better error logging: `[finale] confetti error` (was `[jury] confetti error`)

### Flags & Global Hooks
- `window.__publicFavHooked` - Prevents double wrapping of `startEndCreditsSequence`
- `window.__winnerConfettiDone` - (Not yet implemented, but reserved for future use if needed)
- `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` - Manual trigger for Public Favourite segment

### Flow Sequence
```
1. Jury voting completes
2. Winner announced → showWinnerMessageBanner()
3. Winner confetti spawns (6000ms, 260 particles) ← [finale] winner confetti spawn
4. Victory music plays
5. Sleep 5000ms
6. Medal animation (8000ms) OR showFinaleCinematic()
7. startCreditsPreferred() called from jury.js
8. → startEndCreditsSequence() wrapper intercepts
9.    → IF enablePublicFav: showPublicFavourite(winnerId) ← [publicFav] start/done
10.   → Original credits proceed
```

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Manual trigger (enables toggle, resets guard, runs segment)
window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()

// Direct call (respects current toggle state)
window.game.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()
```

### Accessibility
- Live region already present with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Updates text on each reveal phase
- Progress bars have proper ARIA attributes
- Panel has `role="dialog"` and `aria-label`

### Logging Markers
- `[finale] winner confetti spawn` - When confetti is spawned for winner
- `[publicFav] start` - Public Favourite segment begins
- `[publicFav] done` - Public Favourite segment completes successfully
- `[publicFav] skipped` - When toggle is OFF or already completed
- `[publicFav] error` - On caught exceptions
- `[finale] confetti error` - On confetti spawn errors

## Notes
- No test infrastructure exists in repo, so manual testing recommended
- All changes are minimal and surgical as requested
- Backward compatible - features degrade gracefully if APIs unavailable
- Public's Favourite can be disabled via settings toggle
- Cheer.mp3 audio file should be added to audio/ folder for full functionality
- Confetti function now exists and is called by existing return twist features

## Rich Player Bio Panel Feature

### Overview
Replaced transient rotating tooltip with a stable, data-driven bio panel that displays rich player information when hovering (desktop) or tapping (mobile) roster avatars.

### Key Features

1. **Structured Bio Data**
   - 22 players with complete bios: Name, Gender, Age, Location, Sexuality, Motto, Fun Fact
   - Static bios map in `js/player-bio.js` keyed by exact player names (case-sensitive)
   - Fallback values (`—`) for unmapped players
   - Representation: Includes Bisexual (Lux) and Gay (Rune) characters

2. **Bio Panel Display**
   - **Desktop**: Positioned near cursor with viewport bounds clamping (14px padding)
   - **Mobile**: Bottom-sheet layout (full width, border-radius top corners)
   - Enlarged avatar: 120px (desktop), 96px (mobile screens <640px)
   - Clean two-column grid layout (definition list: labels on left, values on right)
   - Close button (×) in top-right corner
   - Glassy gradient background with shadow (z-index: 650)

3. **Interaction & UX**
   - **60ms debounce** on hover transitions to prevent flicker
   - **Cross-fade animation** when switching between players (150ms opacity transition)
   - **Avatar caching**: First load cached in `player.__avatarUrl` to prevent re-fetching
   - **Escape key** closes panel
   - **Click outside** closes panel on mobile
   - Smooth `bioFadeIn` and `bioSlideUp` animations

4. **Accessibility**
   - **Desktop**: `role="tooltip"`, positioned near trigger
   - **Mobile** (<640px): `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`
   - Escape key support for keyboard users
   - `aria-describedby` set on avatar when panel open
   - Focus management: restore focus to trigger on close

5. **Logging & Diagnostics**
   - `[bio] show id=<id> name=<Name>` - Panel displayed
   - `[bio] hide` - Panel closed
   - `[bio] missing name=<Name>` - Fallback bio used
   - `[bio] attached N bios, M fallbacks` - Bootstrap attachment summary

6. **Public API**
   - `window.showPlayerBio(id)` - Programmatically show bio for player ID
   - `window.__bios` - Access bios map for debugging/inspection

### Implementation Files

#### New Files
- **`js/player-bio.js`**
  - `BIOS` map with all 22 player bios
  - `attachBios(game)` function called after player creation
  - `getBio(name)` helper for name-based lookup
  - Exposed as `window.__bios` for debugging

#### Modified Files
- **`js/bootstrap.js`**
  - Added `global.attachBios?.(g)` after player creation in `buildCast()`
  - Added `global.attachBios?.(g)` in `rebuildGame()` for preserved players

- **`js/ui.hud-and-router.js`**
  - Replaced tooltip system with bio panel
  - New functions:
    - `ensureBioPanel()` - Creates and configures panel element
    - `renderBioContent(p)` - Generates bio HTML from `p.bio` data
    - `positionBioPanel(panel, event)` - Handles desktop/mobile positioning
  - Updated `showProfileFor(p, anchor)` - 60ms debounce, cross-fade, logging
  - Updated `hideProfileTip()` - Cleanup, logging, focus restoration
  - Added `window.showPlayerBio(id)` public API

- **`styles.css`**
  - `.profile-panel` base styles (glassy gradient, shadow, z-index:650)
  - `.profile-panel.mobile` variant (bottom sheet, slide-up animation)
  - `.bio-avatar-container`, `.bio-avatar` (120px/96px responsive sizing)
  - `.bio-name` heading style
  - `.bio-grid` two-column definition list layout
  - `.bio-close-btn` floating close button
  - `@keyframes bioFadeIn` and `@keyframes bioSlideUp` animations

- **`index.html`**
  - Added `<script src="js/player-bio.js"></script>` before bootstrap.js
  - Added version parameter `?v=bio-panel-2` to ui.hud-and-router.js for cache busting

### Usage

**Hover Behavior (Desktop)**
```javascript
// User hovers avatar → showProfileFor(player, event) called
// After 60ms debounce:
// 1. Panel positioned near cursor (clamped to viewport)
// 2. Bio content rendered from player.bio
// 3. Console logs: [bio] show id=2 name=Finn
```

**Mobile Behavior**
```javascript
// User taps avatar → showProfileFor(player, event) called  
// Panel displayed as bottom sheet (role="dialog")
// Close button or click outside closes panel
```

**Programmatic Access**
```javascript
// Show bio for player ID
window.showPlayerBio(5); // Shows bio for player with id=5

// Hide current bio
window.hideProfileTip();

// Access bios map
console.table(window.__bios); // All player bios
```

### Extension Points

**Adding New Players**
```javascript
// In js/player-bio.js, add to BIOS map:
'NewName': {
  gender: 'Female',
  age: 30,
  location: 'City, Country',
  sexuality: 'Straight',
  motto: 'Your motto here',
  funFact: 'Interesting fact'
}
```

**Customizing Bio Panel**
```css
/* In styles.css, modify: */
.profile-panel { /* Panel appearance */ }
.bio-avatar { /* Avatar size */ }
.bio-grid { /* Grid layout */ }
```

**Future Enhancements** (Documented, not implemented)
- Stats tab (wins, threat, nominations)
- Relationship summary (allies, enemies)
- Mini timeline of player journey
- Performance charts
- Editable bios UI

### Testing Verification

✅ Desktop hover shows bio panel near cursor  
✅ Mobile tap shows bottom sheet (CSS-based, no animation yet)  
✅ Cross-fade works when switching players  
✅ Escape key closes panel  
✅ Avatar caching prevents duplicate fetches  
✅ Logging outputs correctly  
✅ Fallback bios work for unmapped names  
✅ Accessible markup (role, aria attributes)  
✅ Debounce prevents flicker on rapid hover  
✅ Focus restoration works (needs keyboard trigger implementation)
