# Post-PR35 Enhancements & Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses all 7 objectives outlined in the problem statement with minimal, surgical changes to the codebase.

## LATEST UPDATE: Clean Finale Flow (Removal of Legacy Overlay)

### Changes Made
**Files Modified:** js/finale.js, js/end-credits.js, js/jury.js

### Key Changes
1. **Removed Legacy End Credits Overlay** (js/finale.js)
   - Removed `.cinDim` / `.cinPanel` overlay with rotating cup
   - Removed manual buttons (New Season / Stats / Credits / Exit)
   - Removed `ensureFinaleStyles()`, `computeStats()`, `statsHtml()`, `ensureOverlay()` functions
   - `showFinaleCinematic()` now only logs deprecation warning and persists winner ID
   - Legacy overlay code removed entirely per requirements

2. **Removed Post-Winner Public Favourite Hook** (js/end-credits.js)
   - Removed integration wrapper that ran Public Favourite AFTER winner announcement
   - Public Favourite now runs exclusively PRE-JURY in jury.js (between casting and reveal phases)
   - Ensures correct flow: jury casting → Public Favourite → jury reveal → outro

3. **Updated Finale Orchestration** (js/jury.js)
   - Removed `showFinaleCinematic` fallback call in medal animation section
   - Changed end sequence to call `playOutroVideo()` directly instead of credits
   - Added fallback to credits sequence if outro video unavailable
   - Maintains proper flow: winner display → medal animation → outro video

### Current Finale Flow (Finalized)
```
1. Jury Casting Phase (anonymous blind voting)
   ├─ Console: [juryCast] start
   ├─ Jurors cast votes without revealing picks
   └─ Console: [juryCast] complete

2. Public Favourite Segment (PRE-JURY, if enabled)
   ├─ Console: [publicFav] start (pre-jury) OR [publicFav] skipped (toggle false)
   ├─ Intro card: "Before we reveal the jury votes and crown the winner..."
   ├─ 5-candidate voting panel with bars
   ├─ Sequential elimination (lowest → highest percentage)
   ├─ Winner enlargement
   ├─ Announcement: "The Public has chosen X... Now let's see who is the Jury's favorite..."
   └─ Console: [publicFav] done

3. Jury Reveal Phase
   ├─ Console: [juryReveal] start
   ├─ Each juror's vote revealed sequentially
   ├─ Live tally updates
   ├─ Winner announced
   └─ Console: [juryReveal] winner=X votes=A-B

4. Winner Display
   ├─ Final tally banner
   ├─ Placement labels
   ├─ Winner message banner
   └─ Victory music (5000ms)

5. Medal Animation
   ├─ Tries medal animation functions
   └─ Fallback to overlay (8000ms)

6. Outro Video (NEW: replaces legacy overlay)
   ├─ Console: [jury] finale complete, triggering outro video
   ├─ playOutroVideo() called
   └─ Fallback to credits sequence if outro unavailable
```

- Enhanced `pickMinigameType()` with:
  - Lazy retry mechanism using `queueMicrotask` if registry not yet loaded
  - Stale miniMode='clicker' cleanup when user switches back to random
  - Shuffled legacy pool fallback with rotating index to ensure variety
- Excludes retired games (typing, reaction, slider, path, simon) from pool

**Acceptance:** Random minigames will vary across runs; no repeated clicker/quickTap bias

### 2. Veto Competition Suspense Reveal (js/veto.js)
**Lines changed:** Added ~60 lines, modified ~10 lines
**Implementation:**

  - Winner card includes 🛡️ veto badge
- Enhanced `finishVetoComp()` to synthesize AI/absent scores before reveal
- All reveals use `cardQueueWaitIdle()` for proper sequencing

**Acceptance:** Scores hidden until reveal; top-3 suspense sequence works correctly

### 4. Rules Update: Final Week Explanation (js/rules.js)
**Lines changed:** Added ~25 lines
**Implementation:**
- Inserted new section "4b. Final Week & Two-Part Final Competition"
- Describes Part 1 (lowest score auto-nominated)
- Describes Part 2 (remaining two compete; winner chooses finalist)
- Proper styling matches existing sections

**Acceptance:** Rules modal displays new final week section

### 5. Public's Favourite Player Feature (js/finale.js + js/settings.js)
**Lines changed:** Added ~140 lines in finale.js, ~15 lines in settings.js

#### js/settings.js
- Added `enablePublicFav: true` to DEFAULT_CFG

- Exposed as `g.playCheerSfx`

#### sw.js
- Bumped CACHE_NAME to 'bb-pwa-v-post-pr35-enhancements'
- Added './audio/cheer.mp3' to CORE cache list

**Acceptance:** Cheer play attempt does not throw if asset absent; cache updated

### 7. Code Quality & Safety
**Implementation across all files:**
- All new template arrays (NOMINATION_OPENERS, VETO_USE_PHRASES, etc.) are const and module-scoped
- All API calls use typeof checks: `typeof g.showCard === 'function'`
- All async operations use try/catch blocks
- No global pollution beyond necessary exports
- Public Favourite feature completely non-blocking with guard flag
- Settings properly persisted to localStorage

**Acceptance:** No uncaught exceptions; safe API usage throughout

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Minigame Randomization:**
   - Start new season, trigger multiple HOH/Veto competitions
   - Verify variety of minigames (not just clicker/quickTap)
   - Change miniMode in settings from 'random' to 'clicker' and back
   - Verify stale mode is cleared

2. **Veto Reveal:**
   - Trigger veto competition
   - Check logs show "X completed" not scores
   - Watch for 3-card reveal sequence with delays
   - Verify winner gets 🛡️ badge

3. **Dialog Variety:**
   - Play through multiple nominations/evictions
   - Verify speech variations (should see different phrases)
   - Check console for no errors

4. **Rules Modal:**
   - Open Rules from settings/button
   - Scroll to section 4b
   - Verify Final Week content is present

5. **Public's Favourite:**
   - Enable/disable toggle in Settings > Gameplay
   - Complete a full season to finale
   - When enabled: verify audience segment → vote panel animation → reveals
   - When disabled: verify feature is completely skipped
   - Check percentages sum to 100

6. **Audio:**
   - Verify cheer.mp3 plays at Fan Favourite reveal (if file present)
   - If file missing, verify no console errors (just graceful log)

## Integration Fix: Public Favourite Invocation + Confetti Reliability

### Changes Made (Post-PR35 Integration)
**Files modified:** js/ui.config-and-settings.js, js/finale.js, js/jury.js

#### js/ui.config-and-settings.js
- **Added `UI.spawnConfetti()` function** (70 lines):
  - Creates visual confetti celebration effect on canvas
  - Parameters: `durationMs` (default 3000), `particleCount` (default 120, max 300)
  - Respects FX settings: skips if both `fxAnim` and `fxCards` are explicitly false
  - Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
  - Random colors, sizes, velocities, and rotation for each particle
  - Gracefully handles missing canvas element or context
  - Try/catch wrapper prevents crashes

#### js/finale.js
- **Enhanced `showPublicFavourite()` with explicit console markers**:
  - `[publicFav] start` - when feature begins execution
  - `[publicFav] done` - on successful completion
  - `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)` - when disabled in settings
  - `[publicFav] skipped (already completed)` - when guard prevents re-run
  - `[publicFav] error: <message>` - on caught exceptions
  - Hard timeout warning: `[publicFav] timed out after 10s`
- **No changes to invocation flow**: `showFinaleCinematic()` already calls `showPublicFavourite()` after 1.5s delay
- **Debug hook**: `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` already exists for QA testing

#### js/jury.js
- **Added winner confetti spawn** after `showWinnerMessageBanner()`:
  - Spawns 180 particles for 5000ms duration
  - Respects FX flags (skips only if both `fxAnim` and `fxCards` are false)
  - Try/catch wrapper with console warning on error
  - Positioned before victory music starts
  - Independent of Public Favourite confetti (winner confetti always fires if enabled)

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ **Toggle Persistence**: Settings modal loads/saves `enablePublicFav` via localStorage  
✅ **Toggle Default**: Set to `false` by default as specified  
✅ **Toggle OFF Behavior**: `showPublicFavourite()` logs `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)` and returns immediately  
✅ **Toggle ON Behavior**: Executes full sequence with `[publicFav] start` and `[publicFav] done` markers  
✅ **Single Execution**: `g.__publicFavouriteCompleted` guard prevents duplicate runs  
✅ **Winner Confetti**: Spawns after winner announcement, before medal/cinematic  
✅ **FX Respect**: Both confetti calls check FX flags before spawning  
✅ **Hard Timeout**: 10s timeout ensures credits progression even on errors  
✅ **No Blocking**: All async operations properly wrapped with try/catch  
✅ **Debug Hook**: `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` available for testing  
✅ **Console Markers**: All required log statements present  

### Integration Flow

**Winner Announcement → Confetti → Public Favourite (if enabled) → Credits**

```
1. Jury votes tallied
2. showPlacementLabels(winner)
3. showWinnerMessageBanner(winner)
4. ⭐ UI.spawnConfetti(5000, 180)  ← NEW
5. Victory music starts
6. Sleep 5000ms
7. Stop music
8. Medal animation (8000ms) OR
9.   → showFinaleCinematic(winner)
10.      → (1500ms delay)
11.      → showPublicFavourite(winner) if enabled  ← Already existed
12.           → Audience segment card
13.           → Voting panel with bars
14.           → Sequential reveals (3rd, 2nd, Fan Favourite)
15.           → Cheer SFX
16.           → Congratulations card
17. Credits sequence
```

### Testing Steps

1. **Confetti Verification**:
   - Play through to finale
   - Verify confetti appears after winner banner
   - Check console for no errors
   - Test with `fxAnim: false` and `fxCards: false` to verify skip

2. **Public Favourite Toggle OFF**:
   - Settings → Gameplay → Uncheck "Public's Favourite Player"
   - Play to finale
   - Console should show `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)`
   - Confetti should still appear for winner
   - No Public Favourite panel should display

3. **Public Favourite Toggle ON**:
   - Settings → Gameplay → Check "Public's Favourite Player"
   - Play to finale
   - Console should show `[publicFav] start` and `[publicFav] done`
   - Winner confetti spawns first
   - Public Favourite panel appears ~1.5s after winner cinematic
   - Vote bars animate
   - Percentages sum to 100%
   - Sequential reveals work
   - Credits follow after completion

4. **Debug Hook**:
   - After finale, open console
   - Run `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()`
   - Should re-trigger Public Favourite segment
   - Check all markers appear in console

5. **Persistence**:
   - Toggle "Public's Favourite Player" ON
   - Save settings
   - Reload page
   - Open settings - checkbox should still be checked

### Known Behavior

- **No confetti during Public Favourite panel**: Confetti is intentionally only for main winner
- **1.5s delay**: Public Favourite starts 1.5s after winner cinematic appears
- **10s hard timeout**: Ensures credits always progress even if errors occur
- **Guard flag**: `g.__publicFavouriteCompleted` prevents duplicate runs per season

## Finale Refactor: Two-Phase Jury + Public Favourite Intermission (No Confetti)

### Summary
Complete refactor of finale flow implementing a two-phase jury vote system with anonymous casting followed by public favourite elimination segment and final reveal. All confetti has been removed globally per spec.

### Key Changes

**Phase 1: Anonymous Jury Casting**
- Jurors cast votes blind (no finalist names shown during casting)
- Votes stored in `game.finale.juryVotesRaw[]`
- Only juror banter shown (from existing templates)
- Console logging: `[juryCast] start`, `[juryCast] vote juror=X stored`, `[juryCast] complete`

**Phase 2: Public Favourite Intermission**
- Runs automatically if >=3 eligible candidates (evicted players)
- Max 5 candidates randomly selected
- Vote percentages normalized to 100%
- Elimination every 3 seconds (lowest percentage eliminated)
- Bar update frequency: ~170ms (via CSS transition)
- Ties resolved randomly
- Console logging: `[publicFav] start N=X`, `[publicFav] eliminate player=X remaining=Y`, `[publicFav] final winner=X pct=XX%`
- Skips if <3 candidates: `[publicFav] skipped reason=insufficient_candidates`

**Phase 3: Jury Reveal**
- Shows each juror's vote with locked-in phrase (JURY_LOCKED_LINES)
- Updates tally and scoreboard live
- Declares winner after all votes (or majority reached)
- Sets `player.winner = true`
- Shows winner card - NO CONFETTI
- Console logging: `[juryReveal] start`, `[juryReveal] show juror=X vote=Y`, `[juryReveal] winner=X votes=A-B`

**Confetti Removal**
- `UI.spawnConfetti()` converted to no-op
- Removed all calls in: js/jury.js, js/jury_return_vote.js, js/jury_return.js, js/twists.js
- No confetti spawns anywhere in the application

**State Additions**
- `game.finale.juryVotesRaw` - Array of {jurorId, pick} objects
- `game.finale.castingDone` - Boolean flag for phase 1 completion
- `game.finale.publicFavDone` - Boolean flag for phase 2 completion  
- `game.finale.revealStarted` - Boolean flag for phase 3 start

**CSS Additions (styles.css)**
- `.pfv-container` - Flexbox container for candidate tiles
- `.pfv-item` - Individual candidate tile (120px width)
- `.pfv-barOuter` - Progress bar container (10px height)
- `.pfv-barFill` - Animated fill (linear-gradient, 180ms transition)
- `.pfv-elim` - Eliminated candidate style (opacity 0, scale 0.85)
- `.pfv-winner` - Winner highlight (outline, box-shadow)
- Reduced motion support via media query

**Helper Functions**
- `ensureFinaleState()` - Initialize game.finale if not present
- `startJuryCastingPhase(jurors, A, B)` - Phase 1 implementation
- `castSingleJurorVote(jurorId)` - (implicit in casting phase)
- `runPublicFavouriteSegment()` - Phase 2 implementation
- `startJuryRevealPhase(jurors, A, B)` - Phase 3 implementation
- `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` - Main orchestrator
- `getLockedJuryPhrase()` - Returns random locked phrase

**Phrase Pools**
- JURY_LOCKED_LINES (6 phrases for reveal phase)

**Safety & Edge Cases**
- <3 candidates: skip public favourite
- Tie eliminations: resolved randomly among lowest
- Hard safety timeout: none needed (sequential execution)
- Guard functions: castingDone, publicFavDone, revealStarted flags

**Accessibility**
- Live region with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Progress bars with `aria-valuemin/max/now`
- Dialog with `role="dialog"` and `aria-label`
- Screen reader class `.sr-only`

## Enhanced Public's Favourite Player Feature (5 Candidates, Pre-Jury Flow)

### Summary
The Public's Favourite Player feature has been enhanced with new timing, expanded candidates (up to 5), elimination animation with winner enlargement, and updated copy to match show style. The feature runs BEFORE jury votes are revealed, creating a natural transition from jury casting to the winner announcement.

### Key Enhancements

**Timing & Flow Integration**
- Runs BEFORE jury reveal phase (between Phase 1 jury casting and Phase 3 vote reveal)
- New integration helper: `g.maybeRunPublicFavouriteBeforeJury()` for explicit invocation
- Toggle-aware: respects `cfg.enablePublicFav` setting (default OFF)
- Single-run guard: `game.finale.publicFavDone` prevents duplicate runs
- Console markers: `[publicFav] start (pre-jury)`, `[publicFav] done`, `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false/already completed)`

**Candidate Selection (Updated)**
- Selects up to 5 distinct houseguests from FULL season cast (evicted + remaining)
- No exclusions - includes finalists since winner not known yet at this stage
- Random shuffle before slicing to ensure variety
- Minimum requirement: 2 players (reduced from 3)
- Previous implementation limited to evicted players only - now uses entire cast

**Intro Card Text (Updated)**
- Title: "Audience Spotlight"
- Line: "Before we reveal the jury votes and crown the winner. Let's see who you voted as your favourite!"
- Duration: 3000ms
- Previous: "Public's Favourite" / "Who will the audience crown?"

**Voting Animation Panel (Enhanced)**
- Grid class: `.pfGrid5` with up to 5 `.pfCell` tiles (previous: 3 tiles in `.pfv-container`)
- Panel width increased to 700px to accommodate 5 candidates
- Each cell: avatar (with descriptive alt text), name, `.pfBarOuter` background, `.pfBarFill` animated fill, percentage label
- Bars animate from 0% to final normalized percentages
- Animation duration: 5 seconds (reduced to 2s if `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`)
- Percentages normalized to total exactly 100% (integer rounding with fix-up pass)

**Elimination Sequence (New)**
- After bar animation completes, candidates sorted ascending by percentage
- Sequential elimination of all but winner with 800ms stagger between each
- Each elimination: `.pfElim` class applied (opacity 0, scale 0.85, fade out)
- Live region announces: "Name eliminated with X%. Y remaining."
- Previous implementation had no elimination animation - just revealed results

**Winner Enlargement (New)**
- After all eliminations complete, eliminated tiles hidden (`display: none`)
- Winner tile enlarged with `.pfWinnerBig` class (scale 1.5, highlight outline 3px, box-shadow glow)
- Winner occupies most of panel width for visual emphasis
- Scale reduced to 1.2 for users with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- 1.2s delay for enlargement animation to complete before announcement

**Winner Announcement Card (Updated)**
- Title: "Fan Favourite"
- Line 1: "The Public has chosen [Name] for their Favourite player!"
- Line 2: "Now let's see who is the Jury's favorite houseguest!"
- Duration: 4000ms
- Immediately proceeds to jury reveal flow after card dismisses
- Previous: "Public's Favourite! 🌟" / "Name — X%" with no jury transition

**Accessibility (Enhanced)**
- Panel has `role="dialog"` and `aria-label="Public's Favourite Player voting"`
- Live region `#publicFavLive` with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Each progress bar has `aria-label`, `aria-valuemin="0"`, `aria-valuemax="100"`, `aria-valuenow` (updated live)
- Avatar images include descriptive alt text: "Name avatar"
- Contrast-compliant background colors (#1b2c3b)

**CSS Classes (New)**
- `.pfGrid5` - Grid container for up to 5 candidates
- `.pfCell` - Individual candidate tile (replaces `.pfv-item`)
- `.pfBarOuter` - Bar background container (replaces `.pfv-barOuter`)
- `.pfBarFill` - Animated fill bar (replaces `.pfv-barFill`)
- `.pfElim` - Elimination state (opacity 0, scale 0.85)
- `.pfWinnerBig` - Enlarged winner state (scale 1.5, outline 3px solid #6fd7ff, box-shadow glow)
- Legacy classes (`.pfv-*`) retained for backward compatibility
- Reduced motion media query: disables transitions, reduces winner scale to 1.2

**Defensive Measures**
- Skip if toggle disabled: logs `[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)`
- Skip if already run: logs `[publicFav] skipped (already completed)`
- Skip if fewer than 2 players: logs `[publicFav] skipped (insufficient players N=X)`
- Try/catch wrapper around entire segment for error safety
- No confetti triggered during this segment (preserves existing winner confetti only)
- Error logging with `[publicFav] error` marker

**Integration Points**
- Old `finale.js` implementation marked as deprecated with warning log
- Debug helper `g.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` updated to prefer new pre-jury flow
- Integration helper `g.maybeRunPublicFavouriteBeforeJury()` exported for external use
- Automatically invoked in `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` between Phase 1 and Phase 3

**Settings Toggle**
- `cfg.enablePublicFav` - defaults to `false` (OFF)
- Located in Settings → Gameplay pane
- Label: "Public's Favourite Player at finale"

**Testing with Debug Helper**
```javascript
// In console after game starts:
game.cfg.enablePublicFav = true;  // Enable feature
game.__debugRunPublicFavOnce();   // Run segment manually

// Reset for re-run:
game.finale.publicFavDone = false;
game.__publicFavouriteCompleted = false;
game.__debugRunPublicFavOnce();
```

## Integration Fix (Public Favourite + Confetti) - PR #39 [DEPRECATED]

### Summary
This section is deprecated. The finale flow has been completely refactored to remove all confetti and implement the new two-phase jury system.

### Changes Made

#### js/end-credits.js
- **Added integration wrapper** (IIFE at end of file):
  - Wraps `window.startEndCreditsSequence` to inject Public Favourite segment before credits
  - Checks `game.cfg.enablePublicFav` flag
  - Finds winner by `p.winner === true`
  - Calls `window.showPublicFavourite(winnerId)` with await
  - Logs `[publicFav] start`, `[publicFav] done`, or `[publicFav] skipped`
  - Try/catch wrapper prevents blocking credits on error
  - `window.__publicFavHooked` flag prevents double wrapping
  - Preserves original function signature and context

#### js/finale.js
- **Removed Public Favourite invocation from `showFinaleCinematic()`**:
  - Public Favourite now runs via credits wrapper (proper sequencing)
  - Added comment explaining the change
- **Enhanced `__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` helper**:
  - Added global `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce` fallback
  - Enables `cfg.enablePublicFav` temporarily
  - Resets `__publicFavouriteCompleted` guard to allow re-run
  - Persists config to localStorage
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Can be called manually from console after finale

#### js/jury.js
- **Enhanced winner confetti spawn**:
  - Changed from `spawnConfetti` to support both `spawnConfetti` and `spawnConfettiOnce`
  - Increased duration to 6000ms and particles to 260 (was 5000ms/180)
  - Added console.info('[finale] winner confetti spawn') log
  - Better error logging: `[finale] confetti error` (was `[jury] confetti error`)

### Flags & Global Hooks
- `window.__publicFavHooked` - Prevents double wrapping of `startEndCreditsSequence`
- `window.__winnerConfettiDone` - (Not yet implemented, but reserved for future use if needed)
- `window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` - Manual trigger for Public Favourite segment

### Flow Sequence
```
1. Jury voting completes
2. Winner announced → showWinnerMessageBanner()
3. Winner confetti spawns (6000ms, 260 particles) ← [finale] winner confetti spawn
4. Victory music plays
5. Sleep 5000ms
6. Medal animation (8000ms) OR showFinaleCinematic()
7. startCreditsPreferred() called from jury.js
8. → startEndCreditsSequence() wrapper intercepts
9.    → IF enablePublicFav: showPublicFavourite(winnerId) ← [publicFav] start/done
10.   → Original credits proceed
```

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Manual trigger (enables toggle, resets guard, runs segment)
window.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()

// Direct call (respects current toggle state)
window.game.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()
```

### Accessibility
- Live region already present with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Updates text on each reveal phase
- Progress bars have proper ARIA attributes
- Panel has `role="dialog"` and `aria-label`

### Logging Markers
- `[finale] winner confetti spawn` - When confetti is spawned for winner
- `[publicFav] start` - Public Favourite segment begins
- `[publicFav] done` - Public Favourite segment completes successfully
- `[publicFav] skipped` - When toggle is OFF or already completed
- `[publicFav] error` - On caught exceptions
- `[finale] confetti error` - On confetti spawn errors

## Notes
- No test infrastructure exists in repo, so manual testing recommended
- All changes are minimal and surgical as requested
- Backward compatible - features degrade gracefully if APIs unavailable

## Card Queue Flush System (PR #49 Completion)

### Summary
Implements a global card flush infrastructure to prevent stale cards from appearing after phase changes, self-evictions, or skips. Includes generation token tracking, abort safety for Public Favourite simulation, and enhanced winner card display.

### Changes Made

#### js/ui.overlay-and-logs.js
**Card Flush Infrastructure:**
- Added `g.__cardGen` global generation token (integer, starts at 1)
- Added `g.__cardTimeouts` array to track active setTimeout IDs
- Implemented `flushAllCards(reason)` function:
  - Increments generation token
  - Clears all tracked timeouts
  - Removes active card DOM nodes (`.bb-card-host`, `[data-bb-card]`, `.revealCard`)
  - Clears tvOverlay and removes tvTall class
  - Logs: `[cards] flushed (reason=${reason})`
- Added `safeShowCard()` wrapper:
  - Captures generation token before showing card
  - Registers timeouts with generation token
  - Checks token before executing callbacks
  - Falls back to tvNow text update if showCard unavailable
- Modified `renderCard()` to add `data-bb-card="true"` attribute to all cards
- Exported `flushAllCards` and `safeShowCard` to global scope

**Lines Changed:** ~80 lines added

#### js/eviction.js
**Self-Evict Flush Hook:**
- Modified `handleSelfEviction()` to call `flushAllCards('self-evict')` when reason is 'self'
- Ensures no stale cards remain when player self-evicts

**Lines Changed:** 5 lines added

#### js/ui.hud-and-router.js
**Skip/Fast-Forward Flush Hook:**
- Modified `fastForwardPhase()` to call `flushAllCards('skip')` at start
- Prevents delayed cards from previous phase appearing during skip

**Lines Changed:** 5 lines added

#### js/jury.js
**Finale Entry Flush Hook:**
- Modified `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` to call `flushAllCards('enter-finale')` at start
- Ensures clean slate before jury voting begins

**Public Favourite Abort Safety:**
- Captured generation token (`myGen`) at start of PF simulation
- Added `aborted` flag to track abort state
- Modified `updatePercentages()` to check generation token and return false if mismatch
- Added abort checks in `scheduleNext()` to stop scheduling new updates
- Added abort checks before panel removal, reveal intro, and winner display
- Logs: `[publicFav] aborted (flush)` when abort detected
- Removes panel immediately on abort

**Enhanced Winner Card:**
- Stores results in `g.__publicFavResult` with winnerId, winnerPct, and entries array
- Creates custom winner card DOM element with:
  - 72px square avatar with object-fit:cover
  - Player name in large font
  - Percentage in 1.5rem font
  - `data-pf-winner="true"` attribute
  - Proper styling: gradient background, gold border, centered layout
  - Responsive: `max-width: min(400px, 90vw)`
- Logs: `[publicFav] winnerCard shown id=${id} pct=${pct}`
- Falls back to regular showCard if error occurs

**Lines Changed:** ~150 lines modified

#### styles.css
**Responsive CSS Adjustments:**
- Added `transition: transform 0.2s ease` to `.pfSlot`
- Added `.pfSlot:hover { transform: translateY(-3px); }` with reduced-motion disable
- Added media query `@media (max-width: 559.98px)`:
  - `.pfVotePanel { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(140px, 1fr)); }`
- Added media query `@media (max-width: 359.98px)`:
  - `.pfVotePanel { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(120px, 1fr)); }`
- Added `.pfWinnerCard` class:
  - `max-width: min(400px, 90vw);`
  - `text-align: center;`
- Updated `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable hover transform

**Lines Changed:** ~30 lines added

### Key Features

**Card Flush System:**
1. **Generation Token:** Global counter incremented on each flush
2. **Timeout Tracking:** All card-related timeouts tracked in global array
3. **DOM Cleanup:** Removes all card elements matching selectors
4. **Abort Safety:** In-flight operations check token and abort if mismatch

**Flush Triggers:**
1. Self-eviction (`'self-evict'`)
2. Phase skip/fast-forward (`'skip'`)
3. Finale entry (`'enter-finale'`)
4. Manual: `window.flushAllCards(reason)` available in console

**Public Favourite Abort Safety:**
- Simulation loop checks generation token every tick
- Aborts cleanly without errors if flush occurs mid-simulation
- Prevents winner reveal if aborted
- Logs abort with reason

**Enhanced Winner Display:**
- Rich card with avatar + name + percentage
- Stores full results for future reference
- Responsive design
- Fallback to regular card on error

### Logging Markers

**Card Flush:**
- `[cards] flushed (reason=self-evict)` - Flush on self-eviction
- `[cards] flushed (reason=skip)` - Flush on phase skip
- `[cards] flushed (reason=enter-finale)` - Flush on finale entry
- `[cards] flushed (reason=unspecified)` - Manual flush without reason
- `[cards] flush DOM cleanup error: ...` - Error during cleanup

**Public Favourite Abort:**
- `[publicFav] aborted (flush)` - PF simulation aborted due to flush
- `[publicFav] winnerCard shown id=X pct=Y` - Winner card displayed

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ **Card Flush Infrastructure:**
- Global generation token implemented and incremented on flush
- Timeout tracking array maintained
- DOM cleanup removes all card elements
- Backward compatible with fallback text update

✅ **Flush Hooks:**
- Self-evict triggers flush
- Skip/fast-forward triggers flush
- Finale entry triggers flush

✅ **PF Abort Safety:**
- Generation token checked each tick
- Simulation stops on mismatch
- Panel removed cleanly
- Winner logic skipped if aborted

✅ **Winner Card Enhancement:**
- Avatar displayed (72px)
- Name and percentage shown
- Results stored in `g.__publicFavResult`
- `data-pf-winner` attribute added

✅ **Responsive CSS:**
- Mobile shows 2 columns (≤559.98px)
- Hover effect with reduced-motion support
- Winner card responsive (≤90vw)
- No horizontal scroll

✅ **Logging:**
- All flush events logged with reason
- PF abort events logged
- Winner card display logged with details

### Non-Goals / Deferred
- **g.setPhase preserveCards flag:** Not implemented as it would require extensive refactoring across multiple modules (not trivial). Left as TODO for future enhancement.

### Testing Recommendations

**Console Testing:**
```javascript
// Test manual flush
window.flushAllCards('test');

// Check generation token
console.log(window.__cardGen);

// Check tracked timeouts
console.log(window.__cardTimeouts);

// Inspect PF results after simulation
console.log(window.__publicFavResult);
```

**Manual Testing:**
1. Trigger self-eviction → verify flush log and no stale cards
2. Skip phases rapidly → verify only current phase cards present
3. During PF simulation, call `window.flushAllCards('test')` → verify clean abort
4. Resize browser to test responsive layouts (800px, 600px, 500px, 340px)
5. Check winner card appearance and styling
