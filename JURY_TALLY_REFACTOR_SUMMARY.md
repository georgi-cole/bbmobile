# Jury Vote Tally Panel Refactor - Summary

## Problem Statement
The final jury vote live tally modal covered the entire TV area and underlying cards/messages, making it a blocking overlay that obstructed important UI elements during the finale.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the blocking modal with a **non-blocking glassmorphism panel** that floats alongside finalist photos without obstructing content.

## Key Changes

### Visual Design
- **Semi-transparent background**: `rgba(10, 15, 22, 0.65)` - 65% opacity
- **Backdrop blur**: `blur(12px) saturate(1.2)` - Modern glass effect
- **Compact footprint**: Max width 280px (desktop) / 340px (mobile)
- **Smooth animations**: Slide-in entrance effect

### Positioning
- **Desktop (>768px)**: Top-right corner at `right: 12px, top: 12px`
- **Mobile (≤768px)**: Top-center at `left: 50%, transform: translateX(-50%)`
- **Winner panel**: Stacked below tally at `top: 56px` with cyan glow

### Responsive Behavior
- Fluid typography using `clamp()`
- Adapts max-width based on viewport
- Repositions for mobile to save horizontal space

## Results

### Validation ✅
All tests passing:
- Tally positioned correctly (right-aligned desktop, centered mobile)
- Glassmorphism effect active (backdrop-filter + transparency)
- Background cards visible (100% visibility maintained)
- Finalist photos fully visible (no obstruction)
- Vote logic works identically
- Winner reveal works correctly

### Browser Testing
- Desktop: 1280x720 ✅
- Mobile: 375x667 ✅
- Game integration: Full jury flow ✅

## Files Changed
1. **js/jury-viz.js** - Updated `.fo-tally` and `.fo-winner` CSS injection
2. **test_jury_tally_panel.html** - New comprehensive test page

## Zero Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- API remains backward-compatible
- Vote bubbles, majority clinch, animations work identically
- No changes to game logic or state management

## Visual Improvements
- Modern glassmorphism aesthetic
- Better visual hierarchy
- Unobstructed finalist photos
- Background content remains visible
- Professional, polished appearance

## Performance
- No performance impact
- CSS-only solution
- Hardware-accelerated animations
- Minimal DOM changes

## Accessibility
- Maintains readability with backdrop blur
- High contrast text on glass background
- Smooth animations for reduced motion users
- Semantic HTML structure preserved
