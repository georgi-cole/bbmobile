# Jury Vote Tally Panel Refactor - Summary

## Problem Statement
The final jury vote live tally modal covered the entire TV area and underlying cards/messages, making it a blocking overlay that obstructed important UI elements during the finale.

## Solution Implemented
Completely redesigned the jury tally UI as an **ultra-transparent inline panel** with maximum glassmorphism, ensuring the TV background and all underlying content remain fully visible and unobstructed.

## Key Changes

### Visual Design (Complete Redesign - Maximum Transparency)
- **Tally panel**: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)` - 8% opacity with `blur(6px)` for minimal visual weight
- **Winner panel**: `rgba(0, 224, 204, 0.12)` - 12% opacity with subtle cyan tint
- **Finalist card backgrounds**: `transparent` - Completely removed, TV fully visible
- **Vote bubbles**: `rgba(0,0,0,0.15)` - 15% opacity with `blur(4px)` glassmorphism
- **Text shadows**: Added for readability over transparent backgrounds
- **Compact footprint**: Max width 280px (desktop) / 340px (mobile)
- **Smooth animations**: Slide-in entrance effect maintained

### Positioning
- **Desktop (>768px)**: Top-right corner at `right: 12px, top: 12px`
- **Mobile (≤768px)**: Top-center at `left: 50%, transform: translateX(-50%)`
- **Winner panel**: Stacked below tally at `top: 56px` with cyan glow

### Responsive Behavior
- Fluid typography using `clamp()`
- Adapts max-width based on viewport
- Repositions for mobile to save horizontal space

## Results

### Validation ✅
All tests passing:
- Tally positioned correctly (right-aligned desktop, centered mobile)
- Glassmorphism effect active (backdrop-filter + transparency)
- Background cards visible (100% visibility maintained)
