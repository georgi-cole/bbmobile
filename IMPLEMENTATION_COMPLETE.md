## Console Output Examples

### Toggle OFF (Expected)
```
[juryCast] start
[juryCast] complete
[publicFav] skipped (toggle false)
[juryReveal] start
```

### Toggle ON - 5 Candidates (Expected)
```
[juryCast] start
[juryCast] complete
[publicFav] start (pre-jury)
[publicFav] eliminate player=Alice pct=12% remaining=4
[publicFav] eliminate player=Bob pct=18% remaining=3
[publicFav] eliminate player=Charlie pct=22% remaining=2
[publicFav] eliminate player=Diana pct=23% remaining=1
[publicFav] done
[juryReveal] start
```

### Edge Case - Insufficient Players (Expected)
```
[juryCast] start
[juryCast] complete
[publicFav] skipped (insufficient players N=1)
[juryReveal] start
```

---

## Integration Points

### Entry Points
1. **Automatic:** `startFinaleRefactorFlow()` calls `runPublicFavouriteSegment()` (jury.js line 807)
2. **Manual:** `game.maybeRunPublicFavouriteBeforeJury()` for explicit invocation
3. **Debug:** `game.__debugRunPublicFavOnce()` for testing

### Settings
- Toggle: Settings → Gameplay → "Public's Favourite Player at finale"
- Default: OFF (`enablePublicFav: false` in settings.js line 27)
- Storage: localStorage under key 'bb_cfg_v2'

### State Management
- `game.finale.publicFavDone` - Single-run guard (prevents duplicates)
- `game.cfg.enablePublicFav` - Toggle state (default false)
- `game.__publicFavouriteCompleted` - Legacy guard (for debug helper)

---

## Browser Compatibility

Expected to work in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile Safari (iOS 12+)
- Mobile Chrome (Android 6+)

**CSS Features Used:**
- CSS Grid (flexbox fallback)
- CSS Transitions
- CSS Transforms
- Gradient backgrounds
- Media queries (prefers-reduced-motion)

**JavaScript Features Used:**
- Async/await
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Array methods (map, filter, sort, slice)
- Spread operator
- Optional chaining (?.  )

---

## Performance Metrics

**Expected Timings:**
- Panel creation: <10ms
- Bar animation: 5000ms (or 2000ms reduced-motion)
- Elimination sequence (5 candidates): 3200ms (800ms × 4)
- Winner enlargement: 1200ms
- Total segment duration: ~9-10 seconds

**Memory:**
- Panel element: ~1KB DOM size
- Images: 5 × avatar sizes (external resources)
- No memory leaks (panel removed after completion)

---

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- ✅ Color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Screen reader support
- ✅ Focus management
- ✅ ARIA landmarks
- ✅ Alt text on images
- ✅ Live regions for announcements
- ✅ Reduced motion support

### Features
- `role="dialog"` on panel
- `aria-label` on panel and progress bars
- `role="status"` on live region
- `aria-live="polite"` for announcements
- `aria-valuemin/max/now` on progress bars
- Alt text on avatar images
- `.sr-only` class for screen reader content

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Minimum 2 players required** - Feature skips if <2 players in cast
2. **No live voting** - Percentages are randomly generated (simulated)
3. **No internationalization** - Text is hardcoded in English
4. **No animation customization** - Timings are fixed (except reduced-motion)
5. **Panel not repositioned** - Fixed center position (no responsive repositioning)

None of these are blockers for the current requirements.

---

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- Real voting integration with backend API
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- Customizable animation timings
- Confetti for Public Favourite winner (currently prohibited)
- Vote history/analytics
- Multiple elimination rounds
- Candidate profiles on hover

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found, revert with:
```bash
git revert 208cbf6^..208cbf6
```

This will restore the previous implementation while preserving git history.

**Old implementation:** Still functional in finale.js (marked deprecated)

---

## Success Criteria ✅
