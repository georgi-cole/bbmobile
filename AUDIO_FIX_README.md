# Audio Playback Bug Fix - README

## üéØ What This PR Fixes

This PR fixes critical bugs in the audio/music playback system that prevented reliable phase-based music from playing during the game.

### Problems Fixed
1. ‚ùå **AbortError in console** - "play() interrupted by pause()"
2. ‚ùå **Audio overlap** - Multiple tracks playing simultaneously
3. ‚ùå **Wrong mute behavior** - Muting paused audio instead of just silencing it
4. ‚ùå **Blocked when muted** - Music wouldn't play at all when muted
5. ‚ùå **Poor logging** - Hard to debug audio issues

### Solution
Made minimal, surgical changes to `js/audio.js` to fix the root causes while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

## üöÄ Quick Start - Testing

### Option 1: Interactive Test Page (Recommended)
1. Open `test_audio_playback.html` in your browser
2. Click the test buttons to verify each fix
3. Watch the console log viewer for detailed output
4. Check the real-time status display

### Option 2: Main Application
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click "Start" button to begin game
3. Observe music starts with intro
4. Skip through phases and verify music switches
5. Toggle mute button and verify behavior
6. Check browser console for clean logs (no AbortError)

## üîç What Changed

### Core File Modified
**`js/audio.js`** - 115 lines changed (+70 insertions, -45 deletions)

### Key Changes
1. **Made stopMusic() async** - Prevents race conditions
2. **Added await to playFile()** - Ensures clean transitions
3. **Fixed setMuted()** - Uses audio.muted instead of pause/resume
4. **Removed play blocking** - Audio plays when muted (just inaudible)
5. **Added comprehensive logging** - Every operation logged
6. **Early isMuted init** - Consistent state management

### New Files Added
- `test_audio_playback.html` - Interactive test page
- `AUDIO_KEY_CHANGES.md` - Side-by-side comparisons
- `AUDIO_PR_SUMMARY.md` - PR overview

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

Quick verification steps:

- [ ] Open `test_audio_playback.html`
- [ ] Test 1: Basic playback works
- [ ] Test 2: Phase transitions switch music cleanly
- [ ] Test 3: Mute toggle works (audio plays but silent)
- [ ] Test 4: Rapid phase changes don't cause errors
- [ ] Test 5: Same track doesn't restart
- [ ] Check console: NO AbortError
- [ ] Check console: Clean start/stop logs
- [ ] Verify status display updates correctly

## üé® Expected Console Output

### Normal Operation
```
[audio] created audio element, muted=false
[audio] starting music, muted=false, file=intro.mp3
[audio] successfully started music, file=intro.mp3
[audio] stopped music, file=audio/intro.mp3
[audio] starting music, muted=false, file=social.mp3
[audio] successfully started music, file=social.mp3
```

### Mute Toggle
```
[audio] muted=true
[audio] starting music, muted=true, file=competition.mp3
[audio] successfully started music, file=competition.mp3
[audio] muted=false
```

### Same Track Protection
```
[audio] starting music, muted=false, file=competition.mp3
[audio] successfully started music, file=competition.mp3
[audio] already playing file=competition.mp3
```

### What You Should NOT See
```
‚ùå Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause()
‚ùå AbortError: play() interrupted by pause()
```

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

### ‚úÖ All Public APIs Unchanged
- `window.playMusicForPhase(nameOrFilename)`
- `window.stopMusic()`
- `window.musicCue(eventName)`
- `window.setMusicVolume(v)`
- `window.setMuted(muted)`
- `window.toggleMute()`
- `window.getMuted()`
- `window.fadeOutMusic(duration)`
- `window.phaseMusic(phase)` - alias
- `window.playMusic(nameOrFilename)` - alias
- `window.playCheerSfx()`

### ‚úÖ Existing Code Works
No changes needed to any code that calls these functions.

---

## üêõ Known Behaviors (Not Bugs)

### "Stop already pending, skipping"
This is **expected** during rapid phase changes. It means the stopPending flag prevented an overlapping stop operation. This is correct behavior that prevents race conditions.

### Autoplay Blocked Message
On first page load, if audio tries to play before user interaction, you may see:
```
[audio] autoplay blocked, waiting for user gesture
```
This is **expected** browser behavior. Audio will play after first click.

### Veto.mp3 Fallback
If `veto.mp3` is missing, you'll see:
```
[audio] veto.mp3 failed; fell back to competition.mp3
```
This is **expected** graceful degradation.

## üìä Performance

### Latency
- **10ms delay added** to stopMusic() to ensure clean pause
- **Impact:** Imperceptible to users
- **Benefit:** Eliminates race conditions and AbortError

### CPU/Memory
- **Reduced operations** - Same-track protection skips unnecessary restarts
- **No memory leaks** - Proper cleanup in stopMusic()
- **Lower CPU** - Fewer redundant play/stop cycles

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Audio Doesn't Play
1. Check browser console for "autoplay blocked" message
2. Click anywhere on page to trigger user gesture
3. Verify audio files exist in `/audio/` directory
4. Check browser audio isn't muted (system mute, not app mute)

### AbortError Still Appears
1. Verify you're testing the updated `js/audio.js` file
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check you don't have old version cached

### Mute Button Not Working
1. Check `js/bootstrap.js` has mute button wiring
2. Verify button exists in HTML with id `btnMuteToggle`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try manually: `window.toggleMute()` in console
